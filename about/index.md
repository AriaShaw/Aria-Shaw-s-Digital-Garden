# About This Garden and Its Gardener

## Who I Am

My name is **Aria Shaw**, and I'm a **Digital Plumber**.

I find broken, leaking, or missing pipes on the internetâ€”specifically, the gaps in knowledge between powerful tools and the ambitious people who need to use them. I thrive on untangling complexity and turning it into a clear, repeatable process.

## What I Do

I build **definitive, battle-tested guides** for business owners who refuse to be held hostage by consulting fees and vendor lock-in.

Every playbook you find here is:

- âœ… **Tested in production** (not theoretical blog filler)
- âœ… **Step-by-step executable** (no hand-waving)
- âœ… **Deeply researched** (I read the source code)
- âœ… **Ruthlessly practical** (no fluff, no SEO spam)

## Why I Built This Garden

This garden is my answer to the frustration of:

- **Fragmented documentation** that assumes you already know the answer
- **Superficial tutorials** that skip the hard parts
- **Vendor marketing** disguised as guides
- **The endless search** for a straight answer

It's a quiet corner of the internet dedicated to the craft of building robust, independent systems. **It is the collection of guides I wish existed when I was stuck.**

## Who This Is For

I build these playbooks for:

- **Fellow builders** who want to understand, not just copy-paste
- **Pragmatists** who value clarity over cleverness
- **Business owners** who believe in digital sovereignty
- **Self-hosters** tired of $50,000+ consulting bills

If you're the kind of person who reads the docs *and* the source code, you're in the right place.

## My Philosophy

### Clarity Over Clutter

The best solution to a complex problem isn't a magic black boxâ€”it's a crystal-clear set of instructions.

### One Guide, One Problem

Each playbook is designed to be **the only resource you need** on that specific topic. No endless rabbit holes of "see also" links.

### Trust Through Transparency

I show my work. Every script is commented, every decision is explained, every gotcha is documented.

## What You'll Find Here

### ðŸ“– Complete Guides

Long-form, comprehensive playbooks covering:

- Odoo self-hosting on AWS/VPS
- Database migration with zero downtime
- Security hardening for production
- Disaster recovery strategies

### ðŸ§° Production-Ready Tools

Open-source scripts and calculators:

- Server sizing calculator (no guesswork)
- Backup automation (battle-tested)
- Migration risk assessor (saves weeks)
- Health monitoring (early warning system)

### ðŸ’¼ The Master Pack

For those who want everything in one place: **5 integrated modules, 68+ tools, 2,000+ pages of documentation**.

No subscriptions, no vendor lock-in. You execute, you own.

## My Background

I've spent years in the trenches:

- Deployed 500+ production Odoo instances
- Rescued dozens of failed self-hosting attempts
- Reverse-engineered vendor solutions to understand what actually matters
- Built automation that saves 40+ hours per month

This isn't theoryâ€”it's field-tested knowledge distilled into repeatable processes.

## How I Work

### Solo, Independent, Unbiased

- No consulting firm overhead
- No vendor partnerships
- No affiliate commissions (besides Gumroad for payment processing)
- Just me, the docs, and a production server

### Open by Default

- Free guides stay free forever
- Core scripts are open-source
- Premium products include source code
- Community feedback shapes priorities
