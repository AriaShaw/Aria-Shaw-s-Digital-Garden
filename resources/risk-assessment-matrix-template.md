## Risk Score Calculation
**Risk Score = Impact Ã— Probability**
- **1-4:** Low Risk (Green) - Standard procedures adequate
- **5-12:** Medium Risk (Yellow) - Enhanced monitoring and mitigation required
- **13-25:** High Risk (Red) - Dedicated mitigation plan and contingencies required

## Mitigation Strategies by Risk Level

- [ ] Dedicated risk owner assigned
- [ ] Detailed mitigation plan with timeline
- [ ] Alternative approaches identified
- [ ] Enhanced monitoring and early warning systems
- [ ] Escalation procedures defined
- [ ] Contingency budget allocated

### Medium Risk Items (Score 5-12)
- [ ] Monitoring plan in place
- [ ] Mitigation strategies identified
- [ ] Resource allocation planned
- [ ] Review checkpoints scheduled

### Low Risk Items (Score 1-4)
- [ ] Standard procedures documented
- [ ] Regular monitoring included in overall plan
- [ ] Basic contingency measures identified
