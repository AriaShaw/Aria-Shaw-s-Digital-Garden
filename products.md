## The Investment

**$699 one-time payment**

That's less than the cost of a single day with a senior Odoo consultant—but you get the complete playbook they'd charge you to build over months.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<div class="faq-item">
<strong>Q: Is this too complex for non-technical users?</strong>

Module 1 requires only Excel—no coding. Modules 2-5 require basic Linux command-line comfort. If you can SSH into a server and run `ls`, you can use these tools. Every script includes step-by-step instructions.
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<strong>Q: What if the tools don't work for my setup?</strong>

14-day money-back guarantee. If the tools don't match the description or don't work as documented, full refund—no questions asked.
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<strong>Q: Do I need all five modules?</strong>

Each module solves different lifecycle stages. Most businesses need at least Modules 1, 2, and 4 (strategic planning, deployment, backup). Modules 3 and 5 become critical as you scale.
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<strong>Q: Will these work with Odoo 18? 17? Community vs. Enterprise?</strong>

The tools are version-agnostic where possible. Scripts include compatibility notes for Odoo 14-18. Works with both Community and Enterprise editions.
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<strong>Q: What if I need help implementing?</strong>

Comprehensive documentation is included (2,000+ pages). For hands-on implementation support, I offer separate consulting services—contact aria@ariashaw.com.
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<strong>Q: How do updates work?</strong>

Free lifetime updates. When I add new tools or improve existing ones, you get them automatically through the delivery platform.
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<strong>Q: Can I get a refund if I change my mind?</strong>

Yes, 14-day money-back guarantee if the toolkit doesn't match what's described here.
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<strong>Q: Is this better than hiring a consultant?</strong>

Different purposes. Consultants do the work for you; this toolkit empowers you to do it yourself. If you want knowledge transfer and permanent capability—this wins. If you want zero involvement—hire a consultant.
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<strong>Q: What format are the tools delivered in?</strong>

Excel files (.xlsx), bash scripts (.sh), Python scripts (.py), Markdown documentation (.md), and configuration files. Everything is plain text and open—no proprietary formats, no DRM.
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<strong>Q: Do these tools work on Windows?</strong>

Excel tools work anywhere. Scripts are Linux-focused (since Odoo runs on Linux). Windows users can use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) or deploy directly on Linux servers.
