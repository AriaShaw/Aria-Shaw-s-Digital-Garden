## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is this too complex for non-technical users?**

Module 1 requires only Excel—no coding. Modules 2-5 require basic Linux command-line comfort. If you can SSH into a server and run `ls`, you can use these tools. Every script includes step-by-step instructions.

**Q: What if the tools don't work for my setup?**

14-day money-back guarantee. If the tools don't match the description or don't work as documented, full refund—no questions asked.

**Q: Do I need all five modules?**

Each module solves different lifecycle stages. Most businesses need at least Modules 1, 2, and 4 (strategic planning, deployment, backup). Modules 3 and 5 become critical as you scale.

**Q: Will these work with Odoo 18? 17? Community vs. Enterprise?**

The tools are version-agnostic where possible. Scripts include compatibility notes for Odoo 14-18. Works with both Community and Enterprise editions.

**Q: What if I need help implementing?**

Comprehensive documentation is included (2,000+ pages). For hands-on implementation support, I offer separate consulting services—contact aria@ariashaw.com.

**Q: How do updates work?**

Free lifetime updates. When I add new tools or improve existing ones, you get them automatically through the delivery platform.

**Q: Can I get a refund if I change my mind?**

Yes, 14-day money-back guarantee if the toolkit doesn't match what's described here.

**Q: Is this better than hiring a consultant?**

Different purposes. Consultants do the work for you; this toolkit empowers you to do it yourself. If you want knowledge transfer and permanent capability—this wins. If you want zero involvement—hire a consultant.

**Q: What format are the tools delivered in?**

Excel files (.xlsx), bash scripts (.sh), Python scripts (.py), Markdown documentation (.md), and configuration files. Everything is plain text and open—no proprietary formats, no DRM.

**Q: Do these tools work on Windows?**

Excel tools work anywhere. Scripts are Linux-focused (since Odoo runs on Linux). Windows users can use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) or deploy directly on Linux servers.
