  main_content: '## Pre-Migration Assessment and Planning


    ### Conducting a Comprehensive System Inventory


    Start your migration with a complete audit of your current Odoo 12 instance. Document
    all installed modules, both standard and custom, with their exact version numbers
    and installation sources. List every third-party application and integration that
    connects to your ERP, including payment gateways, shipping carriers, and external
    APIs. Create an inventory of your reports, data templates, automated actions,
    and scheduled tasks. Record server specifications including CPU cores, RAM allocation,
    PostgreSQL version, and current disk usage. This comprehensive inventory forms
    the foundation of your migration plan and identifies potential compatibility issues.


    Run `pip list` in your Odoo 12 environment to capture all Python dependencies
    with version numbers. Document custom fields added to standard models, especially
    selection field options and computed field logic. List all active workflows, approval
    chains, and email templates that might need adjustment. This detailed documentation
    becomes your migration blueprint.


    ### Analyzing Custom Module Dependencies


    Examine your custom modules for dependencies on deprecated Odoo 12 APIs with a
    systematic code review. Identify modules that use outdated Python libraries or
    obsolete JavaScript frameworks no longer compatible with Odoo 18. Check for hard-coded
    business logic that might conflict with Odoo 18''s updated architecture, particularly
    changes to the accounting system and warehouse management. Search your codebase
    for deprecated decorators like `@api.one`, `@api.multi`, and old-style `onchange`
    methods that need conversion to modern syntax.


    Create a module complexity matrix categorizing each custom module as low, medium,
    or high migration effort. Low complexity modules need only manifest version updates
    and minor Python syntax adjustments. Medium complexity modules require view restructuring
    and moderate code refactoring. High complexity modules demand complete rewrites
    due to fundamental framework changes in the web client or ORM. This analysis determines
    your development workload and helps you prioritize module migration efforts.


    ### Evaluating Data Volume and Complexity


    Measure your actual database size and record counts across critical models including
    res.partner, product.product, sale.order, account.move, and stock.move. Assess
    data complexity by reviewing custom fields, many2many relationships, and hierarchical
    company structures. Identify legacy data that might need archiving instead of
    migration—old quotations, cancelled orders, or inactive products consume migration
    time without business value. Query your database to find records with unusual
    states or incomplete data that need cleanup before migration.


    Use PostgreSQL commands to analyze table sizes: `SELECT schemaname, tablename,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||''.''||tablename)) FROM pg_tables
    WHERE schemaname = ''public'' ORDER BY pg_total_relation_size DESC LIMIT 20;`.
    This evaluation helps you plan migration windows, estimate downtime requirements,
    and identify data cleanup opportunities. You avoid surprises during the actual
    data transfer process.


    ### Establishing Your Migration Timeline


    Build a realistic project timeline based on your assessment findings, allocating
    specific weeks to each phase. Reserve 2-3 weeks for environment setup and custom
    module migration, 1-2 weeks for data migration testing, and 1 week for user training
    and acceptance testing. Include buffer periods for unexpected challenges like
    API compatibility issues or complex data transformation requirements. Coordinate
    your migration schedule with business cycles to minimize operational disruption—avoid
    fiscal year-end, holiday seasons, or peak sales periods. Plan for at least two
    complete practice migrations in staging before attempting production cutover.
    A clear timeline with defined milestones keeps your project on track and manages
    stakeholder expectations.


    ## Environment Preparation and Setup


    ### Building Your Odoo 18 Staging Environment


    Construct a dedicated staging environment that mirrors your production specifications
    exactly. Use identical server hardware or equivalent virtual machine resources
    with matching CPU cores and RAM allocation. Install the same operating system
    version—Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or Debian 12 are recommended for Odoo 18. Upgrade PostgreSQL
    to version 14 or 15, as Odoo 18 requires PostgreSQL 12 minimum but performs better
    on newer versions. Install Odoo 18 from source for maximum control or use the
    official distribution packages for simpler deployment.


    Configure your staging instance with the same deployment architecture as your
    planned production setup. If you use Nginx as a reverse proxy, configure it identically.
    Match your production SSL certificate setup, database connection pooling settings,
    and worker process configuration. Install all required system dependencies including
    Python 3.10+, wkhtmltopdf for PDF reports, and Node.js for asset compilation.
    This environment serves as your primary migration testing ground where you will
    practice the complete migration process multiple times.


    ### Configuring Version Control and Deployment


    Set up a Git repository to manage your Odoo 18 source code and custom modules
    with proper branch organization. Create separate branches for development, staging,
    and production deployments to maintain code stability. Establish clear branching
    workflows where feature branches merge to development, then staging, and finally
    production after testing. Implement a continuous integration pipeline using GitHub
    Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins to automate testing and deployment processes.


    Configure automated tests that run on every commit, including Python linting with
    flake8, security checks with bandit, and unit tests for custom modules. Set up
    deployment scripts that automatically update staging environments when code merges
    to the staging branch. Configure proper backup procedures for both your old Odoo
    12 and new Odoo 18 environments with automated daily backups and retention policies.
    These practices ensure code integrity and enable rapid rollback if issues emerge.


    ### Preparing the Database Migration Path


    Odoo 18 requires PostgreSQL 12 or higher, so audit your current PostgreSQL version
    with `psql --version` and upgrade if necessary. Odoo 12 typically ran on PostgreSQL
    9.6 or 10, which need upgrading to PostgreSQL 14 for optimal Odoo 18 performance.
    Plan your database upgrade using pg_upgrade for minimal downtime or pg_dump/pg_restore
    for maximum safety. Test PostgreSQL extensions like pg_trgm and unaccent work
    correctly after the upgrade.


    Consider whether to attempt direct migration from Odoo 12 to 18 or use intermediate
    version stepping through Odoo 14 and 16. Direct migration requires more complex
    data transformations but reduces overall project time. Intermediate version jumps
    provide safer incremental changes but extend the project timeline. Prepare database
    backup and restoration procedures for each migration attempt, including scripts
    that automate the backup-restore-test cycle. Test your backup recovery process
    to verify data integrity and measure restoration time. Solid database preparation
    prevents catastrophic data loss scenarios during the actual migration.


    ### Setting Up Monitoring and Logging


    Implement comprehensive monitoring for both your old Odoo 12 and new Odoo 18 instances
    using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or New Relic. Configure application performance
    metrics including request duration, database query tracking with pg_stat_statements,
    and system resource monitoring for CPU, memory, and disk I/O. Set up centralized
    logging with the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Graylog to capture
    errors, warnings, and user activities during testing phases.


    Establish alert thresholds for performance degradation, error rate increases above
    baseline, and resource exhaustion conditions. Configure alerts to notify your
    team via email, Slack, or PagerDuty when critical thresholds are breached. Good
    monitoring provides visibility throughout your migration and enables rapid response
    to issues before they impact users.


    ## Custom Module Migration Strategy


    ### Analyzing Module Compatibility


    Systematically review each custom module against Odoo 18''s extensive API changes
    using a structured compatibility audit. Identify deprecated model attributes like
    old-style `_columns` definitions replaced by new field declarations. Search for
    removed method parameters in commonly used APIs like `create()`, `write()`, and
    `search()`. Review obsolete view definitions that use deprecated `<field>` attributes
    or unsupported widget types. Check your module manifests for deprecated keys and
    update category names to match the new classification system.


    Verify compatibility with Python 3.10+ by checking for removed standard library
    modules and deprecated syntax like old-style string formatting. Test PostgreSQL
    12+ compatibility by reviewing custom SQL queries for deprecated functions or
    changed behaviors. Examine JavaScript code for dependencies on removed jQuery
    plugins or outdated Backbone.js patterns. This comprehensive analysis creates
    your module migration priority list with accurate effort estimates for each component.


    ### Rewriting Models and Business Logic


    Update your model definitions to align with Odoo 18''s ORM enhancements and modern
    Python patterns. Replace all deprecated `@api.one` decorators with `@api.model`
    for class methods or proper recordset iteration for instance methods. Convert
    old `@api.multi` decorators to the standard approach where methods operate on
    recordsets natively. Update `@api.depends` decorators to use correct field paths,
    especially for related fields and computed fields with complex dependencies.


    Adapt computed fields to use the updated API signatures with proper `compute`,
    `inverse`, and `search` method definitions. Modify constraints to return proper
    ValidationError exceptions with translatable error messages. Update business logic
    to use current transaction handling with explicit `self.env.cr.commit()` and `self.env.cr.rollback()`
    where appropriate. Replace deprecated `self.pool` references with `self.env` for
    all model access. Modernize search domain construction to avoid deprecated operators
    and use proper domain combination techniques. These changes ensure your modules
    function correctly and efficiently in the new environment.


    ### Modernizing Views and User Interface


    Redesign your views using Odoo 18''s updated frontend architecture and responsive
    design principles. Convert legacy QWeb templates to use current syntax with proper
    `t-` directives and expression evaluation. Update form views to utilize the new
    field widgets and layout components like `<sheet>`, `<header>`, and `<div class="oe_chatter">`.
    Modernize tree views with updated column definitions, decoration attributes, and
    optional grouping features. Adapt kanban views to use current card layouts and
    quick-create functionality.


    Convert legacy JavaScript widgets to the new Owl component system where you have
    complex UI components. Rewrite custom JavaScript actions and client-side logic
    to use the modern RPC framework and promise-based async patterns. Update CSS styling
    to work with Odoo 18''s updated Bootstrap framework and custom CSS variables.
    Remove dependencies on deprecated jQuery plugins and replace with native JavaScript
    or approved Odoo alternatives. These improvements deliver a consistent, professional
    user experience that matches standard Odoo 18 modules.


    ### Testing Module Integration


    Create comprehensive test suites for your migrated custom modules using Odoo''s
    testing framework. Develop unit tests for model methods that verify business logic,
    computed field calculations, and constraint enforcement. Write tests for CRUD
    operations that ensure proper record creation, updates, and deletion with correct
    access rights. Test onchange methods and their UI impacts to verify they trigger
    correctly and update dependent fields.


    Build integration tests that verify module interactions with standard Odoo features
    like stock management, accounting integration, and reporting engines. Test workflows
    end-to-end, including multi-step approval processes and automated actions. Verify
    security rules and record rules enforce correct access controls for different
    user groups. Perform user acceptance testing with actual end users to validate
    workflows, interface usability, and business process compliance. Run performance
    tests to identify slow queries or memory leaks in your migrated code. Thorough
    testing catches regressions and compatibility issues before they impact production
    users.


    ## Data Migration Architecture


    ### Designing Your Migration Data Flow


    Architect a robust data migration pipeline that extracts, transforms, and loads
    your information with proper dependency handling. Plan sequential migration waves
    based on data dependencies—start with base data like res.country, res.currency,
    and product.category, then progress to res.partner and product.product, followed
    by transactional data like sale.order, account.move, and stock.picking. Map all
    many2one relationships to ensure parent records exist before child records. Design
    your process to handle datasets with millions of records without excessive memory
    consumption by using batch processing with configurable chunk sizes.


    Create a migration order matrix that lists all models in dependency sequence with
    estimated record counts and processing times. Identify circular dependencies between
    models and plan how to break them using temporary field disabling or multi-pass
    loading. This structured approach maintains data integrity throughout the transfer
    and enables parallel processing of independent model groups.


    ### Building Extraction Scripts for Odoo 12


    Develop Python scripts that connect to your Odoo 12 instance using XML-RPC for
    API-based extraction or direct database access for performance-critical migrations.
    Use the XML-RPC approach for standard data with code like `models.execute_kw(db,
    uid, password, ''sale.order'', ''search_read'', [[]], {''fields'': [''name'',
    ''partner_id'', ''date_order'']})`. Extract data in configurable batches of 100-1000
    records to manage memory and prevent connection timeouts on large datasets.


    Include logic to handle related records with proper many2one and many2many relationship
    preservation. Export foreign key IDs alongside human-readable names to facilitate
    mapping validation. Create data dumps in JSON or CSV format with UTF-8 encoding
    to preserve special characters and multilingual content. Implement progress tracking
    with logging to monitor extraction speed and identify slow models. These scripts
    form the first stage of your migration pipeline with built-in error recovery.


    ### Transforming Data for Odoo 18 Compatibility


    Map your Odoo 12 data structures to Odoo 18''s updated model schema with detailed
    field-level transformation rules. Convert selection field values to match new
    option sets—many selection fields in accounting and inventory management changed
    between versions. Transform datetime fields from naive to timezone-aware formats
    as Odoo 18 enforces stricter timezone handling. Adapt monetary fields to account
    for changed decimal precision requirements in specific currencies.


    Cleanse data proactively by removing test records, development artifacts, and
    demo data that accumulated in your production database. Consolidate duplicate
    partner records using fuzzy matching on name and VAT numbers. Archive obsolete
    product variants, old quotations past retention periods, and cancelled orders
    that serve no business purpose. Update state machine values where workflow states
    changed between versions. This comprehensive transformation ensures your data
    fits the new system perfectly and improves overall data quality.


    ### Loading Data into Odoo 18


    Implement data loaders that use Odoo 18''s ORM for proper record creation with
    all business logic and constraints enforced. Process data in strict dependency
    order, creating parent records before their children to satisfy foreign key constraints.
    Include comprehensive error handling for validation failures with detailed logging
    of which records failed and why. Implement duplicate detection using external
    ID mappings that track Odoo 12 IDs to Odoo 18 IDs for consistent relationship
    mapping.


    Create progress tracking with checkpoint/resume capabilities for migrations handling
    millions of records. Store processed record IDs in a separate tracking table so
    failed migrations can resume without reprocessing successful batches. Implement
    transaction batching where you commit every 1000 records to balance performance
    with rollback granularity. These loaders complete your migration pipeline with
    reliable, resumable data insertion.


    ### Validating Data Integrity


    Develop verification scripts that compare record counts between Odoo 12 and Odoo
    18 for every migrated model. Compare aggregated financial totals, inventory valuation,
    and account receivables to ensure numerical accuracy within tolerance thresholds.
    Check relational data consistency by verifying all many2one and one2many links
    resolve to existing records. Validate business logic by running reports in both
    systems and comparing outputs. Perform sample audits on critical business data
    like invoices, purchase orders, and stock movements by reviewing 1% of records
    in detail. This comprehensive validation confirms your migration preserved data
    accuracy and completeness.


    ## Step-by-Step Migration Execution


    ### Preparing for Production Migration


    Schedule your production migration during a period of minimal business activity
    like weekends or month-end after financial close. Send detailed communication
    to all users at least one week in advance explaining the downtime window, expected
    duration, and what to expect when systems return. Notify integration partners
    and external systems that connect to your Odoo instance. Perform final backups
    of both your Odoo 12 database using `pg_dump` and the complete filestore directory
    containing all attachments and documents.


    Document your rollback procedure with specific commands and time estimates in
    case you encounter critical issues that block go-live. Prepare a rollback decision
    tree that defines what severity of issues trigger rollback versus temporary workarounds.
    Test your rollback procedure in staging to ensure you can restore Odoo 12 within
    your acceptable downtime window. These thorough preparations minimize business
    disruption during the cutover.


    ### Executing the Database Migration


    Stop all Odoo 12 processes including the main server, scheduled action workers,
    and any background job processors to prevent data changes during migration. Verify
    all processes stopped by checking system process lists and database connection
    counts. Create a final database backup and verify its integrity with a test restore
    to a temporary database. Run your extraction scripts to capture the current production
    state with all recent transactions.


    Execute your transformation and loading procedures according to your tested migration
    plan, processing models in the documented dependency order. Monitor the process
    for errors, memory usage, and processing speed using your prepared monitoring
    dashboards. Log all warnings and errors to files for later analysis. Track progress
    with regular status updates to stakeholders about which models completed and estimated
    time remaining.


    ### Verifying Core Functionality


    After completing the data migration, start your Odoo 18 instance with `odoo-bin
    -d production_db --test-enable` to run built-in tests. Perform initial smoke tests
    by logging in with admin and regular user accounts. Verify that you can access
    main menus, view critical data like customer lists and product catalogs, and navigate
    between modules. Check that basic operations like creating a sales order, registering
    a payment, and generating an invoice function correctly with proper validation
    and workflow progression.


    Test critical integrations with external systems including payment gateways, shipping
    carriers, and third-party APIs to ensure they remain operational with correct
    authentication and data exchange. Verify email sending works correctly through
    your configured SMTP server. Run key financial reports and compare output to your
    Odoo 12 baseline for accuracy. These quick validations confirm your system is
    ready for broader user acceptance testing.


    ## Post-Migration Validation and Optimization


    ### Validating Business Process Integrity


    Verify that all critical business processes function correctly in the new environment
    through comprehensive end-to-end testing. Test complete order-to-cash cycles starting
    from quotation creation through sales order confirmation, delivery, invoicing,
    and payment receipt. Validate procurement-to-payment workflows including purchase
    requisitions, vendor bill processing, three-way matching, and payment execution.
    Test manufacturing operations covering bill of materials, work orders, material
    consumption, and finished goods receipt.


    Confirm that reporting outputs match expected results by running parallel reports
    in both Odoo 12 (historical) and Odoo 18 systems. Verify financial data consistency
    by reconciling trial balances, aged receivables, and inventory valuations between
    systems. Test multi-company operations if applicable, ensuring proper inter-company
    transactions and consolidated reporting. Validate tax calculations, especially
    for complex tax jurisdictions with multiple rates or special rules. This comprehensive
    end-to-end validation ensures complete business continuity after the migration.


    ### Monitoring System Performance


    Track key performance indicators continuously during the first week post-migration.
    Measure page load times for common screens like sales orders, invoices, and product
    lists. Monitor report generation speed for complex reports like financial statements
    and inventory analytics. Track database query performance using PostgreSQL''s
    `pg_stat_statements` extension to identify slow queries consuming excessive resources.


    Compare these metrics against your Odoo 12 baseline to identify performance regressions
    that need attention. Use Odoo''s built-in performance profiling with the `--dev=all`
    flag during testing to understand rendering bottlenecks. Analyze PostgreSQL execution
    plans for slow queries with `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`. Add database indexes on frequently
    queried fields that lack proper indexing. Tune PostgreSQL configuration parameters
    like `shared_buffers`, `work_mem`, and `effective_cache_size` based on your server
    resources. Continuous monitoring helps you optimize the system during the critical
    stabilization period.


    ### Training Users on New Features


    Develop comprehensive training materials that highlight Odoo 18''s improvements
    including the redesigned user interface, enhanced search capabilities, and improved
    mobile experience. Create role-specific training modules for sales representatives,
    warehouse staff, accounting personnel, and managers focusing on their specific
    workflows and daily tasks. Record video tutorials demonstrating common operations
    like creating quotations, processing shipments, and running financial reports.


    Conduct hands-on training sessions in small groups organized by department and
    job function. Use real production data in training databases so users recognize
    familiar customers and products. Address interface changes that might confuse
    users, explaining why certain menus moved or features changed. Create quick reference
    guides for common tasks with screenshots showing the new interface and updated
    procedures. Establish a support channel via Slack, Teams, or email for users to
    ask questions during the learning period. Proper training accelerates user adoption
    and maximizes your investment in the upgrade.


    ### Establishing Ongoing Maintenance


    Implement a regular backup schedule for your new Odoo 18 environment with daily
    full database backups and continuous filestore synchronization. Set up monitoring
    alerts for system health metrics like disk space usage, database connection pool
    exhaustion, and memory consumption. Configure error tracking with email or Slack
    notifications for critical exceptions. Plan for regular security updates by subscribing
    to Odoo security advisories and applying patches within defined SLA windows.


    Document the new architecture including server topology, database configuration,
    custom module inventory, and operational procedures for your team. Create runbooks
    for common maintenance tasks like adding new users, updating modules, and troubleshooting
    performance issues. These practices ensure long-term system stability and operational
    excellence.


    ## Security and Compliance Enhancements


    ### Implementing Odoo 18 Security Features


    Configure Odoo 18''s enhanced security options to protect your system against
    modern threats. Enable stronger password policies requiring minimum 12 characters
    with complexity rules enforcing uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
    Activate two-factor authentication for all administrative users and optionally
    for regular users handling sensitive data. Configure session timeout to automatically
    log out inactive users after 30 minutes, reducing the risk of unauthorized access
    from unattended workstations.


    Activate security-related logging to track all authentication attempts, failed
    logins, and privilege escalations. Enable audit logging for sensitive operations
    like user creation, permission changes, and financial record modifications. Review
    and update access control lists to follow the principle of least privilege, ensuring
    users only access data and features required for their job functions. Implement
    record rules to restrict data visibility based on user roles, departments, or
    companies. Configure field-level security to hide sensitive information like employee
    salaries or customer credit limits from unauthorized users. These comprehensive
    measures strengthen your system against both external attacks and internal security
    breaches.


    ### Addressing Compliance Requirements


    Leverage Odoo 18''s improved GDPR compliance features for comprehensive data protection.
    Configure data retention policies that automatically archive or delete personal
    data after defined periods according to legal requirements. Implement privacy
    controls that allow customers to request data exports or deletion through self-service
    portals. Enable cookie consent management for your public-facing Odoo websites
    and e-commerce platforms.


    Implement detailed audit trails for sensitive operations including financial transactions,
    inventory movements, and customer data modifications. Configure the audit log
    to capture who made changes, when they occurred, what values changed, and from
    which IP address. Enable immutable logging that prevents audit trail tampering
    by storing logs in append-only format. For regulated industries like healthcare
    or finance, configure additional compliance features like electronic signature
    capture for approvals, timestamp validation for document authenticity, and retention
    locks preventing premature record deletion. These capabilities help maintain compliance
    with GDPR, HIPAA, SOX, and other evolving regulations.


    ### Securing Integrations and APIs


    Review all external integrations for security compliance in the new Odoo 18 environment.
    Update API authentication to use current standards like OAuth 2.0 for third-party
    applications instead of storing API keys in plaintext. Implement JWT tokens with
    short expiration times for mobile app authentication. Enable API rate limiting
    to prevent denial-of-service attacks and abuse, capping requests at 100 per minute
    per client.


    Implement comprehensive input validation for all custom API endpoints to prevent
    SQL injection, XSS attacks, and other injection vulnerabilities. Sanitize user
    inputs and use parameterized queries exclusively. Enable HTTPS-only communication
    for all API endpoints with proper TLS 1.3 configuration. Configure CORS headers
    to restrict API access to authorized domains only. Implement API logging to track
    all external requests, responses, and errors for security monitoring and incident
    investigation. These precautions protect your system from external threats and
    ensure secure data exchange with partner systems.'
