  introduction: 'Linode (Akamai Cloud)''s Dedicated 8 GB instance delivers the compute
    and memory resources that Odoo 18 requires for production deployments serving
    Medium Business (40-100 users). The 4 dedicated vCPUs handle concurrent user requests
    without CPU steal, while 8GB RAM provides sufficient headroom for PostgreSQL query
    caching.


    Odoo deployments fail most often from accumulated small configuration errors rather
    than single catastrophic mistakes. Installing PostgreSQL without tuning shared_buffers
    creates memory pressure. Configuring NGINX without extended timeouts causes request
    failures. Running Odoo without proper systemd management means manual restarts
    after updates. Each individual mistake seems minor until they compound into production
    instability.'
  deployment_guide: 'Deploying Odoo 18 on Linode requires understanding the dedicated
    versus shared CPU trade-off before launching infrastructure. Dedicated CPU plans
    guarantee compute resources exclusively for your instance, eliminating the noisy
    neighbor problem. For production Odoo serving 40-100 concurrent users, the Dedicated
    8 GB plan at $72 monthly provides consistent response times during month-end reporting
    or bulk import operations.


    Create your Linode account and immediately generate an API token through the account
    settings panel. Launch a Dedicated 8 GB instance through the Cloud Manager interface,
    selecting Ubuntu 24.04 LTS as your distribution. Choose a region based on user
    geography rather than arbitrary preference. The instance provisions in 30-60 seconds.


    Linode''s Cloud Firewall feature provides network-level protection separate from
    instance-level UFW rules. Create a Cloud Firewall policy allowing inbound traffic
    on ports 22, 80, and 443, then attach it to your Odoo instance. Install PostgreSQL
    16 from the official PostgreSQL APT repository. Create a dedicated PostgreSQL
    user for Odoo with createdb privileges.


    Separate your database storage from application storage using Linode Block Storage
    volumes. Create a 50 GB block storage volume at $5 monthly, attach it to your
    instance, format it with ext4, and mount it at /var/lib/postgresql. This separation
    enables independent scaling where you expand database storage without resizing
    the entire instance.


    Install Odoo 18 Community Edition from GitHub, creating a dedicated odoo system
    user. Configure Odoo to run as a systemd service with nine workers for four cores.
    Obtain an SSL certificate through Certbot and Let''s Encrypt, configuring automatic
    renewal via systemd timer. Install Nginx as a reverse proxy, handling SSL termination
    and static file serving.


    Configure application-level backups using pg_dump for PostgreSQL and filestore
    archives, storing encrypted copies in Linode Object Storage at $5 monthly for
    250 GB. Total monthly operating cost reaches approximately $97: $72 for the Dedicated
    8 GB instance, $5 for block storage, $5 for Object Storage, and miscellaneous
    charges for backups and transfer.

    '
  conclusion: 'The Deploy Odoo 18 on Linode (Akamai Cloud): Complete 2025 Guide architecture
    you implemented on Linode (Akamai Cloud) provides a scaling foundation that supports
    business growth without infrastructure rebuilds. The current Dedicated 8 GB configuration
    handles Medium Business (40-100 users), but the deployment patterns you followed—separated
    application and database tiers, reverse proxy SSL termination, automated backup
    systems—scale linearly when user counts increase.


    Growth-related infrastructure changes require minimal effort because you built
    on production-grade foundations from the start. Upgrading to a larger instance
    type takes thirty minutes and involves stopping services, resizing the instance
    through Linode (Akamai Cloud)''s console, adjusting PostgreSQL parameters for
    the new RAM allocation, and restarting services. Adding a read replica for reporting
    workloads requires similar effort. Implementing high availability with load-balanced
    application servers builds on the NGINX configuration you already deployed. You
    established architectural patterns that accommodate scaling without starting over.


    Your immediate focus should shift to operational excellence. Validate your backup
    restoration process by performing a complete recovery to a test instance. Establish
    monitoring baselines for normal CPU, memory, and disk usage patterns so you can
    identify anomalies before they cause outages. Document configuration decisions
    and administrative procedures for future team members. The infrastructure work
    is complete—operational maturity and application layer optimization represent
    your next leverage points for extracting maximum value from this $50-100 monthly
    infrastructure investment.



    Before declaring your deployment complete, run the [backup readiness checker](/toolkit/odoo-backup-readiness-checker/).
    This 60-second assessment validates encryption, tests restoration procedures,
    and confirms off-site storage configuration.'
