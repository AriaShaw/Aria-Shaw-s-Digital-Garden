  main_content: '## Integration Architecture and Data Flow


    ### Core Integration Patterns


    Amazon Seller Central integration with Odoo 18 follows two primary data exchange
    patterns: real-time API calls for critical operations and scheduled batch processing
    for bulk data synchronization. The architecture centers on Odoo as the system
    of record, with Amazon serving as a sales channel that feeds data into your core
    business operations. You must design this integration to handle Amazon''s API
    rate limits while maintaining data consistency across both systems.


    The integration uses Odoo''s built-in Amazon Connector module as its foundation,
    extending it with custom development for specific business requirements. This
    module provides the basic framework for connecting to Amazon''s Selling Partner
    API (SP-API), which replaced the older MWS API. Your implementation will build
    upon this foundation, adding custom synchronization logic and error handling tailored
    to your specific Amazon marketplace and product catalog.


    ### Data Flow Directionality


    Orders flow from Amazon to Odoo as sales orders, triggering your standard order
    processing workflow. Inventory updates move from Odoo to Amazon, ensuring your
    stock levels remain synchronized across all sales channels. Product information
    typically originates in Odoo and publishes to Amazon, though some businesses maintain
    product data in Amazon and sync to Odoo. You must establish clear master data
    ownership for each data type to prevent synchronization conflicts.


    The integration handles multiple data types with different synchronization priorities.
    Order data requires near-real-time processing to ensure prompt fulfillment, while
    inventory updates can operate on a scheduled basis. Product information changes
    less frequently but demands careful validation to maintain Amazon''s catalog requirements.
    Financial data, including settlements and fees, follows a daily synchronization
    pattern for accounting reconciliation.


    ### Authentication and Security Framework


    Amazon''s SP-API uses OAuth 2.0 authentication with a Login with Amazon (LWA)
    token exchange. You configure this through Amazon''s Seller Central developer
    permissions, granting your Odoo instance specific API roles. The system exchanges
    these tokens automatically, maintaining secure access without manual intervention.
    Odoo stores these credentials encrypted within its database, protecting your Amazon
    account access.


    The data flow incorporates multiple security layers, including HTTPS encryption
    for all API communications and credential rotation according to Amazon''s security
    policies. Your implementation must handle token refresh operations transparently,
    ensuring continuous synchronization without manual reauthentication. Amazon enforces
    strict rate limits that your integration must respect through intelligent request
    throttling and queue management.


    ### Error Handling Architecture


    The integration architecture incorporates a multi-layered error handling approach.
    Network timeouts and temporary Amazon API issues trigger automatic retries with
    exponential backoff. Data validation errors require human intervention, logging
    detailed context for troubleshooting. The system maintains synchronization queues
    with dead letter handling for persistent failures, ensuring one problematic record
    never blocks the entire integration.


    You design the data flow to maintain transactional integrity where possible, though
    Amazon''s API limitations sometimes require compensating transactions. For example,
    if an inventory update fails after order import, the system must track this discrepancy
    for manual resolution. The architecture includes comprehensive logging and monitoring
    to provide visibility into synchronization health and data consistency across
    systems.


    ## Step-by-Step Configuration


    ### Prerequisites and Environment Setup


    Begin by verifying your Odoo 18 instance meets the technical requirements for
    Amazon integration. Ensure you run Odoo 16.0 or later with the Amazon Connector
    module version 16.0.2 or higher. Install necessary Python dependencies including
    boto3 for AWS signature generation and cryptography for token management. Configure
    your Odoo instance with proper SSL certificates, as Amazon''s SP-API requires
    secure HTTPS connections.


    Register your integration in Amazon Seller Central through the Developer Central
    portal. Create a new application, selecting the SP-API option and specifying the
    appropriate roles for your integration scope. Amazon requires detailed business
    information and use case descriptions for approval. Download your LWA credentials
    (Client ID and Client Secret) and note your Seller ID, as you will need these
    for Odoo configuration.


    Prepare your AWS account for the integration by creating an IAM user with programmatic
    access. Configure this user with an IAM policy that grants permission to execute
    the Selling Partner API actions your integration requires. Generate AWS access
    keys for this IAM user, as Amazon''s SP-API requires AWS Signature Version 4 for
    request authentication. Store these credentials securely for the Odoo configuration
    phase.


    ### Odoo Amazon Connector Installation


    Install the Odoo Amazon Connector module through your Odoo application interface
    or deploy it manually to your custom addons directory. Enable the module in Odoo''s
    Apps menu, which adds Amazon-specific configuration options to your Sales and
    Inventory modules. The module creates new menu items for Amazon operations and
    extends existing Odoo models with Amazon-specific fields and behaviors.


    Navigate to the Amazon configuration section under Sales > Configuration > Amazon
    Accounts. Create a new Amazon account record, providing a descriptive name for
    your marketplace connection. Select your Amazon marketplace from the predefined
    list, as this determines the API endpoint and regional settings. Odoo supports
    all major Amazon marketplaces including North America, Europe, Japan, and Australia
    through separate endpoint configurations.


    Configure the authentication parameters using the credentials from your Amazon
    Developer Central registration. Enter your LWA Client ID and Client Secret in
    the respective fields. Provide your Amazon Seller ID and the AWS access keys from
    your IAM user configuration. Test the connection using the verification function,
    which attempts to authenticate with Amazon''s API and returns success or detailed
    error information.


    ### API Scope and Permission Configuration


    Define the specific API operations your integration requires based on your business
    processes. For basic order synchronization, enable orders and order items permissions.
    For inventory management, add listings and inventory permissions. Product synchronization
    requires catalog items permissions, while financial data needs finances permissions.
    Request only the permissions your business requires, as broader scopes increase
    security exposure.


    Configure these permissions in Amazon Seller Central under Apps and Services >
    Develop Apps. Edit your application to select the appropriate roles, which correspond
    to API permission groups. Amazon may require additional verification for certain
    roles, particularly those accessing financial or customer data. Once configured,
    these permissions determine which API operations your Odoo integration can perform.


    Implement permission validation in your Odoo configuration by testing each enabled
    scope with a corresponding API call. For example, test order permissions by attempting
    to retrieve recent orders, or inventory permissions by trying to update a listing
    quantity. Log permission errors for troubleshooting and ensure your Odoo users
    understand which operations require specific Amazon permissions.


    ### Synchronization Policy Configuration


    Define your synchronization policies for each data type based on business requirements
    and Amazon API limitations. Configure order import to run every 15-30 minutes
    during business hours, balancing responsiveness with API rate limit conservation.
    Set inventory export to batch updates every 2-4 hours, or implement real-time
    updates for critical products with low stock levels.


    Configure the order import filters to match your business rules. Set conditions
    based on order status, fulfillment channel, and marketplace. Exclude certain order
    types like pending orders or test orders based on your operational preferences.
    Define how Odoo handles various Amazon order attributes like shipping service
    levels, gift messages, and special delivery instructions.


    Set up product synchronization according to your catalog management approach.
    Configure whether Odoo creates new products for unrecognized Amazon SKUs or flags
    them for review. Define price synchronization rules, including whether Odoo overwrites
    Amazon prices or respects manual overrides. Establish category mapping between
    Amazon product categories and Odoo''s product categories for accurate reporting.


    ### Advanced Configuration and Customization


    Extend the base Amazon Connector with custom fields mapping for your specific
    business needs. Use Odoo''s studio module or custom Python code to map additional
    Amazon order attributes to Odoo sales order fields. For example, map Amazon''s
    buyer-tax-location attribute to Odoo''s fiscal position fields for accurate tax
    calculation in multi-state sales scenarios.


    Implement custom synchronization filters using Odoo''s domain filter syntax. Create
    rules that exclude certain products from inventory synchronization or prioritize
    order processing for specific marketplaces. These filters help manage API rate
    limits by reducing unnecessary synchronization operations while focusing on business-critical
    data flows.


    Configure logging and monitoring appropriate for your operational scale. Enable
    detailed synchronization logs for troubleshooting while setting up log rotation
    to prevent database bloat. Configure Odoo''s scheduled actions with proper error
    notifications and performance monitoring. Implement dashboard alerts for synchronization
    failures or performance degradation.


    ## Data Mapping and Transformation


    ### Order Data Structure Mapping


    Amazon orders arrive with a complex nested JSON structure that Odoo must flatten
    into its sales order model. The integration maps Amazon''s order ID to Odoo''s
    origin field, preserving the reference for future synchronization. Amazon order
    items transform into Odoo sale order lines, with careful handling of product matching
    through SKU or ASIN identifiers.


    The mapping process handles Amazon-specific order attributes that lack direct
    Odoo equivalents. Gift messages map to Odoo''s sale order notes, while shipping
    service level selections translate to Odoo''s shipping policy fields. Amazon''s
    order total breakdown separates into Odoo''s tax, shipping, and subtotal fields
    based on Amazon''s item promotion and tax calculations.


    Address mapping presents particular challenges due to format differences between
    Amazon and Odoo. Amazon''s single-line address fields require parsing into Odoo''s
    structured address format. The integration handles international address variations,
    extracting relevant components like street names, building numbers, and apartment
    identifiers for proper shipping label generation.


    ### Product and Inventory Mapping


    Product synchronization between Odoo and Amazon requires careful identifier management.
    Odoo products match Amazon listings through SKU mapping, with fallback to ASIN
    matching for certain scenarios. The integration maintains a cross-reference table
    that tracks these relationships, enabling bidirectional updates while preserving
    data integrity.


    Inventory quantity mapping must account for different reservation models between
    the systems. Odoo''s available quantity concept differs from Amazon''s fulfillable
    quantity, requiring calculation adjustments. The integration computes available
    quantities by considering Odoo''s stock reservations and Amazon''s pending orders
    to prevent overselling across channels.


    Product attribute mapping handles the translation between Odoo''s product variants
    and Amazon''s variation relationships. Odoo product templates map to Amazon parent
    listings, while Odoo product variants map to Amazon child listings. The integration
    maintains these relationships during synchronization, ensuring price and inventory
    updates apply to the correct listing variations.


    ### Financial Data Transformation


    Amazon settlement reports arrive as structured CSV files that the integration
    parses into Odoo accounting entries. Each settlement line item maps to appropriate
    Odoo account moves, with transaction types determining the account mapping. The
    system creates separate journal items for product sales, Amazon fees, shipping
    charges, and tax collections.


    The financial transformation handles currency conversion for international marketplaces,
    using exchange rates from the settlement period. Amazon''s tax calculation complexity
    requires careful mapping to Odoo''s tax structure, particularly for marketplace
    facilitator tax scenarios where Amazon calculates and remits sales tax automatically.


    Fee mapping identifies each Amazon charge type and allocates it to the appropriate
    expense account. Subscription fees, referral fees, FBA fees, and advertising charges
    all map to separate accounts for accurate cost tracking. The integration matches
    these fees to the relevant sales transactions, enabling proper gross margin calculation
    per order.


    ### Custom Field Mapping Scenarios


    Business-specific data requirements often demand custom field mapping beyond the
    standard integration. Amazon''s business order attributes like PO numbers or buyer
    company names may map to custom Odoo fields for B2B sales tracking. The integration
    supports these extensions through Odoo''s custom field mechanism and mapping configuration.


    Complex product data scenarios require specialized transformation logic. Amazon''s
    variation themes like size-color combinations need mapping to Odoo''s attribute
    value combinations. Bundle products on Amazon may map to Odoo''s kit products
    or bill of materials, depending on the fulfillment model. These mappings preserve
    the product structure across both systems.


    ## Error Handling and Resilience


    ### Common API Integration Errors


    Amazon''s SP-API returns specific error codes that your integration must handle
    gracefully. Quota exceeded errors (429 HTTP status) trigger automatic retry with
    exponential backoff, respecting Amazon''s rate limits. Invalid input errors (400
    status) require data validation and administrator notification, as they indicate
    fundamental data issues.


    Authentication errors (401/403 status) often stem from expired LWA tokens or revoked
    IAM permissions. The integration detects these errors and initiates token refresh
    procedures automatically. Persistent authentication failures escalate to administrator
    alerts, as they may indicate credential configuration problems or Amazon policy
    changes.


    Temporary service errors (500/503 status) from Amazon''s API endpoints trigger
    retry logic with increasing delays. The integration differentiates between transient
    errors that resolve with retries and persistent errors that require investigation.
    Circuit breaker patterns prevent continuous retries for consistently failing operations.


    ### Data Validation and Conflict Resolution


    Data validation errors occur when Amazon data violates Odoo''s business rules.
    Orders with invalid product references create synchronization failures that require
    manual resolution. The integration logs these errors with complete context and
    moves problematic records to a quarantine area for investigation without blocking
    subsequent orders.


    Inventory synchronization conflicts arise when parallel updates create race conditions
    between Odoo and Amazon. The integration uses optimistic locking with version
    stamps to detect these conflicts, applying last-write-wins semantics or escalating
    to manual resolution based on business rules. This prevents inventory drift while
    maintaining synchronization performance.


    Product data conflicts present when the same product receives updates from both
    systems simultaneously. The integration employs master data ownership rules to
    determine which system prevails in conflict scenarios. Configuration determines
    whether Odoo or Amazon serves as the master for product attributes like title,
    description, and imagery.


    ### Synchronization Failure Recovery


    The integration maintains detailed synchronization logs that track each data exchange
    attempt. These logs capture request payloads, response data, and error details
    for troubleshooting. When failures occur, administrators can replay specific synchronization
    operations from the logs after addressing the root cause.


    For catastrophic failures like database corruption or extended Amazon API outages,
    the integration supports bulk resynchronization procedures. These processes rebuild
    the synchronization state from a specific timestamp, reprocessing all data exchanges
    since the failure point. The system handles duplicate detection to prevent creating
    redundant records during recovery.


    Partial synchronization failures require compensating transactions to maintain
    data consistency. If order import succeeds but inventory update fails, the system
    tracks this discrepancy for manual resolution. Recovery procedures identify these
    inconsistent states and provide tools for administrators to reconcile the systems.


    ## Testing and Validation


    ### Development Environment Testing


    Establish a dedicated Amazon Seller Central sandbox account for integration testing.
    This sandbox environment provides realistic API behavior without affecting your
    live marketplace operations. Configure a separate Odoo instance that mirrors your
    production environment for end-to-end testing of the integration.


    Create comprehensive test data that covers all your business scenarios. Generate
    test orders with various product types, shipping methods, and customer locations.
    Prepare inventory scenarios that test synchronization under low-stock conditions
    and backorder situations. Develop product catalog test cases that include simple
    products, variants, and kits.


    Execute integration tests that validate each data flow in isolation before testing
    end-to-end scenarios. Test order import with different order statuses and fulfillment
    methods. Verify inventory export with quantity changes and stock reservations.
    Validate product synchronization with new creations, updates, and deletions.


    ### Production Validation Procedures


    Before going live, execute a phased validation approach that starts with read-only
    operations. Test API connectivity and data retrieval without making any changes
    to either system. Progress to one-way synchronization, typically from Amazon to
    Odoo, before enabling bidirectional data flow.


    Implement a pilot program with limited data scope for initial production testing.
    Select a specific product category or marketplace for the initial rollout. Monitor
    synchronization accuracy and performance before expanding to your entire catalog.
    This contained approach limits potential business impact from integration issues.


    Establish validation checkpoints that compare key metrics between systems. Verify
    order counts match between Amazon and Odoo for specific date ranges. Reconcile
    inventory levels for a sample of products to ensure quantity synchronization accuracy.
    Compare financial totals from Amazon settlements with Odoo accounting entries.


    ### Performance and Load Testing


    Measure synchronization performance under various load conditions to establish
    performance baselines. Test order import with different batch sizes to determine
    optimal synchronization frequency. Measure inventory export performance with large
    product catalogs to identify potential bottlenecks.


    Validate the integration''s behavior under Amazon API rate limiting. Test how
    the system handles quota exceeded errors and whether retry logic functions correctly.
    Verify that synchronization queues properly handle backpressure without data loss
    when API limits constrain throughput.


    Conduct endurance testing over extended periods to identify memory leaks or performance
    degradation. Run continuous synchronization for 48-72 hours while monitoring system
    resources and synchronization latency. This testing reveals issues that may not
    appear during shorter test cycles.


    ## Security Considerations


    ### Authentication and Credential Management


    Amazon SP-API integration requires multiple credential sets that demand secure
    management. LWA credentials (Client ID and Client Secret) authenticate your application
    to Amazon''s identity services. AWS IAM credentials sign API requests to Amazon''s
    Selling Partner API. Odoo database credentials access your business data. Store
    all credentials encrypted using strong encryption algorithms, never in plain text
    configuration files.


    Implement secure credential rotation procedures that refresh tokens before expiration.
    Amazon LWA refresh tokens have indefinite lifespan but require secure storage.
    AWS IAM keys should rotate quarterly according to security best practices. Automate
    these rotation processes where possible, with manual fallback procedures for failure
    scenarios.


    Control access to integration configuration based on role-based access controls.
    Limit Amazon credential management to authorized administrators only. Audit configuration
    changes and access attempts to detect potential security incidents. Implement
    principle of least privilege, granting only necessary permissions for each user
    role.


    ### Data Protection and Privacy


    The integration handles sensitive business information including sales data, customer
    details, and financial records. Encrypt data in transit using TLS 1.2 or higher
    for all API communications. Encrypt sensitive data at rest within Odoo''s database,
    particularly customer personal information and financial records.


    Comply with data privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA when handling European
    or California customer data. Implement data retention policies that automatically
    purge sensitive information after business needs expire. Anonymize personal data
    used for testing and development to prevent exposure of real customer information.


    Secure API endpoints against common web vulnerabilities. Validate all input data
    from Amazon to prevent injection attacks. Implement proper error handling that
    avoids exposing sensitive system information in error messages. Regular security
    scanning identifies potential vulnerabilities in your integration code.


    ### API Security and Access Controls


    Configure Amazon SP-API with restrictive IAM policies that grant only necessary
    permissions. Regularly review and audit these permissions to ensure they align
    with current business requirements. Implement IP restriction where possible, limiting
    API access to known network ranges.


    Monitor API usage for anomalous patterns that may indicate security breaches.
    Unexpected spikes in order downloads or inventory updates might signal unauthorized
    access. Implement alerting for suspicious activities like access from unusual
    locations or at unusual times.


    Secure your Odoo instance against unauthorized access through strong authentication
    mechanisms. Implement two-factor authentication for administrative users. Regularly
    update Odoo and its dependencies to patch known security vulnerabilities. Conduct
    security audits to identify potential weaknesses in your deployment.


    ## Performance Optimization


    ### API Rate Limit Management


    Amazon''s SP-API enforces strict rate limits that vary by endpoint and marketplace.
    The integration must track usage across all endpoints and implement intelligent
    throttling to avoid quota exceeded errors. Implement token bucket algorithms or
    similar rate limiting patterns that smooth request distribution throughout quota
    periods.


    Prioritize API calls based on business criticality, ensuring order synchronization
    receives quota allocation before less time-sensitive operations like product updates.
    Implement queue prioritization that processes high-priority synchronization tasks
    first while deferring background operations during peak usage periods.


    Batch operations reduce API call volume for certain operations. Inventory updates
    can combine multiple SKU changes into single batch requests where supported. Product
    information updates benefit from batch processing when making related changes
    across multiple listings. These batch operations conserve your API quota for critical
    real-time synchronization.


    ### Database Optimization Techniques


    Odoo database performance directly impacts integration throughput, particularly
    for large product catalogs or high-order volumes. Implement appropriate database
    indexing on Amazon synchronization tables, particularly on fields used for matching
    and lookup operations. Regular database maintenance including vacuum and analyze
    operations maintains query performance.


    Optimize Odoo''s scheduled action configuration to prevent overlapping synchronization
    jobs. Stagger different synchronization processes to distribute database load
    throughout the synchronization cycle. Monitor database locks during synchronization
    to identify and resolve contention issues that slow integration performance.


    Implement query optimization for custom synchronization logic, avoiding N+1 query
    patterns that create excessive database load. Use Odoo''s read_group operations
    for aggregation instead of processing large record sets in Python. These optimizations
    become critical as your data volume grows with business expansion.


    ### Caching Strategies


    Implement strategic caching for reference data that changes infrequently. Amazon
    marketplace definitions, product categories, and fee descriptions represent good
    caching candidates. These caches reduce API calls for static reference data while
    ensuring synchronization performance for dynamic operational data.


    Use Odoo''s in-memory caching for frequently accessed Amazon-related data like
    product cross-references and marketplace settings. Configure appropriate cache
    expiration policies that balance performance with data freshness requirements.
    Monitor cache hit ratios to validate caching effectiveness and adjust strategies
    as needed.


    Implement request-level caching for Amazon API responses where appropriate, particularly
    for product information lookups during order processing. These caches reduce redundant
    API calls for the same data within short timeframes while maintaining overall
    data consistency across the integration.'
