  human_notes: |
    Key strategic positioning:

    1. Vultr's High Performance AMD instances show 20% better response times than regular SSD for database workloads
    2. Price-to-performance ratio is competitive: $24/mo for production-ready small business setup
    3. NVMe storage critical for PostgreSQL performance - emphasize this in content
    4. Docker Compose simplifies deployment vs manual install (AriaShaw existing content uses manual)
    5. Let's Encrypt SSL automation is a key differentiator vs complex manual cert management
    6. Workers formula (1 + vCPU*2) should be prominently featured
    7. Session storage configuration often overlooked - critical performance win
    8. Vultr firewall must block 8069 direct access - security emphasis
    9. Link to existing AriaShaw scripts: backup_odoo.sh, monitor_odoo.sh for post-deployment
    10. Position as "production-ready in 30 minutes" vs multi-day manual setup

  introduction: |
    Deploying Odoo 18 on Vultr Cloud using Docker Compose eliminates the complexity of manual installations while delivering production-ready infrastructure in under 30 minutes. Unlike traditional bare-metal setups that require intricate dependency management and multi-step configurations, Docker Compose encapsulates your entire Odoo environment—application server, PostgreSQL database, and networking—into a single declarative file.

    Vultr's High Performance AMD instances with NVMe storage provide a 20% performance boost over standard SSD configurations, making them ideal for PostgreSQL-intensive workloads like Odoo. For a small business with 10-15 users, you're looking at just $24/month for compute plus $5/month for backup storage—significantly less than managed hosting alternatives while maintaining full control over your data sovereignty.

    This guide walks you through the complete deployment process: provisioning a Vultr instance, configuring Docker Compose with optimized settings for Odoo 18 and PostgreSQL 16, setting up Nginx as a reverse proxy with Let's Encrypt SSL, and tuning performance parameters based on your server specifications. You'll also get production-ready configurations for security hardening, automated backups, and monitoring that you can deploy immediately.

  step_by_step_guide: |
    **Step 1: Create Vultr Compute Instance (5 minutes)**

    Log into your Vultr account and click "Deploy New Server". Select "Cloud Compute" and choose your location (pick the region closest to your users for lowest latency). Under operating system, select Ubuntu 24.04 LTS x64. For server size, choose "High Performance AMD - 2 vCPU" ($24/month) if you have 5-15 users, or "High Performance AMD - 4 vCPU" ($48/month) for 15-50 users. The NVMe storage on these plans significantly improves PostgreSQL query performance compared to regular SSD instances.

    Add your SSH key under "SSH Keys" (if you don't have one, generate it with `ssh-keygen -t ed25519`). Disable "Auto Backups" for now—we'll set up a better backup strategy later. Set a server hostname like "odoo-production" and click "Deploy Now". Wait 3-5 minutes for the instance to provision, then note the IP address.

    **Step 2: Configure Vultr Firewall Rules (3 minutes)**

    Before connecting to your server, set up firewall rules. In the Vultr dashboard, navigate to "Firewall" and create a new firewall group named "odoo-production-fw". Add these inbound rules:
    - Port 22 (SSH): Source = Your IP address only (for security)
    - Port 80 (HTTP): Source = Anywhere (0.0.0.0/0) - needed for Let's Encrypt validation
    - Port 443 (HTTPS): Source = Anywhere (0.0.0.0/0) - your production traffic

    Critical: Do NOT open port 8069. Odoo will run on this port internally, but all external traffic must go through Nginx on port 443. Attach this firewall group to your instance.

    **Step 3: Install Docker and Docker Compose (5 minutes)**

    SSH into your server: `ssh root@YOUR_SERVER_IP`. Update the package index and install prerequisites:

    ```bash
    apt update && apt upgrade -y
    apt install -y ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release
    ```

    Add Docker's official GPG key and repository:

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
    echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
    ```

    Install Docker Engine and Docker Compose v2:

    ```bash
    apt update
    apt install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin
    ```

    Verify installation: `docker compose version`. You should see version 2.10 or higher. Note: Use `docker compose` (with space), not the deprecated `docker-compose` command.

    **Step 4: Create Project Directory Structure (2 minutes)**

    Create a dedicated directory for your Odoo deployment:

    ```bash
    mkdir -p /opt/odoo/{addons,config,postgres-data,odoo-data}
    cd /opt/odoo
    ```

    This structure separates custom addons, configuration files, and persistent data volumes. Set proper permissions:

    ```bash
    chmod -R 755 /opt/odoo
    ```

    **Step 5: Configure docker-compose.yml (5 minutes)**

    Create your Docker Compose configuration file. See the `docker_compose_generator` section below for the complete configuration. Save it as `/opt/odoo/docker-compose.yml`. This configuration uses PostgreSQL 16 (recommended for Odoo 18), sets up named volumes for data persistence, and configures a dedicated network for container communication.

    Key settings to note:
    - PostgreSQL uses `shared_buffers=1024MB` (25% of 4GB RAM)
    - Odoo is configured with 5 workers (1 + 2*2 for 2 vCPU instances)
    - Both containers restart automatically on failure or server reboot

    **Step 6: Set Environment Variables (3 minutes)**

    Create a `.env` file in `/opt/odoo/` to store sensitive credentials:

    ```bash
    cat > /opt/odoo/.env <<EOF
    POSTGRES_DB=odoo
    POSTGRES_USER=odoo
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
    ODOO_ADMIN_PASSWD=$(openssl rand -base64 24)
    EOF
    ```

    Secure the file: `chmod 600 /opt/odoo/.env`. This generates strong random passwords for PostgreSQL and Odoo's master password.

    **Step 7: Launch Containers (3 minutes)**

    Start the Odoo stack:

    ```bash
    cd /opt/odoo
    docker compose up -d
    ```

    Verify both containers are running: `docker compose ps`. You should see `odoo-web` and `odoo-db` with status "Up". Check logs: `docker compose logs -f odoo-web`. Wait for the message "odoo.service.server: HTTP service (werkzeug) running on 0.0.0.0:8069". Press Ctrl+C to exit logs.

    Test internal access: `curl http://localhost:8069/web/database/selector`. If you see HTML output, Odoo is running correctly.

    **Step 8: Install and Configure Nginx (5 minutes)**

    Install Nginx:

    ```bash
    apt install -y nginx
    systemctl enable nginx
    ```

    Create Nginx configuration for Odoo. See the `nginx_config_snippet` section below for the complete configuration. Save it as `/etc/nginx/sites-available/odoo` and create a symlink:

    ```bash
    ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/odoo /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
    rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
    ```

    Test configuration: `nginx -t`. If successful, reload: `systemctl reload nginx`.

    **Step 9: Configure SSL with Let's Encrypt (5 minutes)**

    First, point your domain's DNS A record to your Vultr server IP. Verify propagation: `dig yourdomain.com` should show your server IP.

    Install Certbot:

    ```bash
    apt install -y certbot python3-certbot-nginx
    ```

    Obtain SSL certificate:

    ```bash
    certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com -d www.yourdomain.com
    ```

    Follow the prompts. Choose option 2 to redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS. Certbot automatically modifies your Nginx config and sets up auto-renewal via systemd timer. Verify renewal works: `certbot renew --dry-run`.

    **Step 10: Optimize PostgreSQL Settings (5 minutes)**

    PostgreSQL's default settings aren't optimized for Odoo. See the `postgresql_tuning_script` section for a complete tuning script. Run it to apply settings based on your instance's RAM. Restart PostgreSQL container: `docker compose restart odoo-db`.

    **Step 11: Configure System Monitoring (3 minutes)**

    Increase file watch limit for Odoo's auto-reload feature:

    ```bash
    echo "fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
    sysctl -p
    ```

    Set up log rotation for Odoo:

    ```bash
    cat > /etc/logrotate.d/odoo <<EOF
    /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log {
        rotate 7
        daily
        compress
        missingok
        delaycompress
        copytruncate
    }
    EOF
    ```

    **Step 12: Verify Deployment and Create Admin User (5 minutes)**

    Open your browser and navigate to `https://yourdomain.com`. You should see the Odoo database creation screen. Fill in:
    - Database Name: `production` (or your company name)
    - Email: Your admin email
    - Password: Strong password (not the same as ODOO_ADMIN_PASSWD in .env)
    - Language: Your language
    - Country: Your country

    Click "Create Database". Wait 2-3 minutes for initial setup. Once complete, you'll be logged into Odoo 18. Install your first app to verify everything works. Your production Odoo instance is now live.

    **Configuration Explanation:**

    - **PostgreSQL tuning**: `shared_buffers=1024MB` allocates 25% of 4GB RAM for database caching. `effective_cache_size=3GB` tells PostgreSQL how much RAM is available for caching. `random_page_cost=1.1` is optimized for NVMe SSDs (default 4.0 is for spinning disks).

    - **Odoo workers**: `--workers=5` follows the formula `1 + (vCPU * 2)` for 2-core instances. This enables multiprocess mode for better concurrency. `--max-cron-threads=1` ensures scheduled tasks don't compete with web requests.

    - **Memory limits**: `--limit-memory-hard=2684354560` (2.5GB) prevents memory leaks from crashing the server. `--limit-memory-soft=2147483648` (2GB) triggers worker recycling before hard limit.

    - **Security**: Port 8069 is bound to `127.0.0.1` only—not accessible from internet. `--proxy-mode` enables Odoo to trust X-Forwarded-For headers from Nginx. `--dbfilter=^%d$` prevents database enumeration attacks.

    - **Health checks**: PostgreSQL health check ensures database is ready before Odoo starts. Odoo health check monitors web service availability for container orchestration.

    **Configuration Highlights:**

    - **Database manager blocking**: The `location ~* /web/database` block prevents public access to Odoo's database management interface, a critical security measure for production.

    - **Static file caching**: `/web/static/` files (CSS, JS, images) are cached for 10 days with `immutable` flag. This reduces Odoo worker load by 30-40% for returning visitors.

    - **Rate limiting**: `limit_req_zone` allows 10 requests per second per IP with a burst buffer of 20. Prevents brute-force attacks on login forms.

    - **SSL hardening**: Only TLS 1.2+ with strong ciphers. HSTS header ensures browsers always use HTTPS for 1 year after first visit.

    - **Longpolling**: Odoo 18's real-time features (chat, notifications) use WebSocket-like connections on port 8072. This requires a separate upstream to avoid timeout issues.

    **Usage Instructions:**

    Save this script as `/opt/odoo/tune_postgresql.sh`, make it executable with `chmod +x /opt/odoo/tune_postgresql.sh`, and run it: `./tune_postgresql.sh`. The script automatically detects your instance's RAM and calculates optimal PostgreSQL settings.

    **Key Optimizations:**

    - **shared_buffers**: 25% of RAM is the recommended starting point for OLTP workloads like Odoo. Values above 8GB rarely provide additional benefit.

    - **effective_cache_size**: Tells PostgreSQL's query planner how much RAM is available for caching. Set to 75% of total RAM since we're on a dedicated Odoo server.

    - **random_page_cost=1.1**: Default is 4.0 for spinning disks. Vultr's NVMe storage has nearly random and sequential access speeds equal, so we reduce this to favor index scans.

    - **autovacuum tuning**: Aggressive autovacuum settings (`naptime=10s`) prevent the database bloat that commonly causes Odoo slowdowns after 6-12 months of production use.

    - **log_min_duration_statement=500**: Logs any query taking longer than 500ms. Use this to identify poorly optimized database operations in custom modules.

  common_mistakes: |
    **1. Deploying on Under-Spec'd Instances**

    The single most common mistake is choosing Vultr's $10/month 1 vCPU plan to save costs. While this meets Odoo's minimum requirements on paper (2GB RAM), you'll hit performance walls immediately with 5+ concurrent users. PostgreSQL and Odoo compete for the same CPU core, causing request queueing during peak usage. Instead, start with the High Performance AMD 2 vCPU plan at $24/month. The NVMe storage alone provides 20% faster database queries than regular SSDs, and the second core prevents CPU contention between database and application.

    **2. Not Blocking Port 8069 at the Firewall**

    Many administrators configure Nginx as a reverse proxy but forget to block direct access to Odoo's port 8069. This creates a massive security hole—users can bypass Nginx's rate limiting, SSL, and access controls by hitting port 8069 directly. In Vultr's firewall settings, ensure you ONLY allow ports 22 (SSH from your IP), 80 (HTTP for Let's Encrypt), and 443 (HTTPS). Port 8069 should never appear in your inbound rules. In your docker-compose.yml, bind Odoo to `127.0.0.1:8069` (not `0.0.0.0:8069`) to prevent external access.

    **3. Skipping Worker Configuration (Running Single-Process Mode)**

    Odoo's default configuration runs in single-process mode, meaning it can only handle one request at a time. With 5 users clicking around simultaneously, the fifth user waits for the first four to complete. Set `--workers=5` (formula: 1 + vCPU * 2) in your docker-compose.yml command arguments. This enables multiprocess mode where Odoo spawns 5 worker processes, each handling concurrent requests. Don't forget to also set `--max-cron-threads=1` to prevent scheduled tasks from consuming worker slots.

    **4. Using Default PostgreSQL Settings Without Tuning**

    PostgreSQL's out-of-the-box configuration is designed to run on a 128MB RAM machine from 1998. Shared_buffers defaults to 128MB regardless of your instance size—leaving gigabytes of RAM unused. On a 4GB Vultr instance, PostgreSQL should use 1GB for shared_buffers (25% of RAM) and have effective_cache_size set to 3GB (75% of RAM). Use the tuning script in this guide to calculate optimal settings. The performance difference between default and tuned PostgreSQL can be 3-5x for complex Odoo queries.

    **5. Disabling or Ignoring AUTOVACUUM**

    This is a slow-burning disaster that won't show up until months after deployment. PostgreSQL's AUTOVACUUM process cleans up dead rows and updates query statistics. Disabling it (which some performance guides incorrectly suggest) leads to database bloat—we've seen production databases slow down by 2000% after 6 months due to this. Keep autovacuum enabled and tune it aggressively: set `autovacuum_naptime=10s` and `autovacuum_max_workers=3`. Monitor with `docker exec odoo-db psql -U odoo -d postgres -c 'SELECT * FROM pg_stat_all_tables WHERE n_dead_tup > 1000;'`.

    **6. Forgetting DNS Propagation Before SSL Setup**

    Enthusiastic admins often run `certbot --nginx` immediately after creating their Vultr instance, before updating DNS records. Let's Encrypt validation fails because the domain doesn't resolve to the new server IP yet. DNS propagation can take 1-48 hours depending on your registrar. Before running Certbot, verify DNS with `dig yourdomain.com @8.8.8.8` or `nslookup yourdomain.com`. You should see your Vultr IP address. If not, wait and check again in an hour. Failed validation attempts count against Let's Encrypt's rate limits (5 failures per hour).

    **7. Not Configuring Nginx to Serve Static Files**

    By default, Nginx proxies ALL requests to Odoo, including static assets like CSS, JavaScript, and images. This wastes 30-40% of your worker capacity serving files that never change. Configure Nginx location blocks for `/web/static/` with long cache headers (`expires 864000;` = 10 days) and `proxy_cache_valid 200 304 60m`. This tells Nginx to cache these files in memory and serve them directly without bothering Odoo workers. For a site with 20 active users, this single change can reduce Odoo's CPU usage by 25%.

    **8. Storing Sessions in PostgreSQL (Default Behavior)**

    Odoo 18 defaults to storing user sessions in the PostgreSQL database. Every page load triggers a session read/write, creating unnecessary database load. For production deployments with 10+ concurrent users, this becomes a significant bottleneck. Configure Odoo to store sessions on the filesystem by adding `--session-storage=filesystem` to your docker-compose.yml command arguments. For even better performance on multi-instance setups, use Redis: `--session-storage=redis --redis-host=redis --redis-port=6379`.

    **9. Using Outdated 'docker-compose' Command**

    If you're following older guides, you might use `docker-compose up -d` (with hyphen). Docker deprecated this standalone tool in favor of the integrated `docker compose` (with space) plugin. The v2 plugin is faster, better integrated with Docker Engine, and required for modern features like health checks and profiles. Verify you have v2 installed: `docker compose version` should show 2.10 or higher. If you see command not found, install the docker-compose-plugin package as shown in this guide's installation steps.

    **10. No Backup Strategy for Docker Volumes**

    Docker volumes (`odoo-db-data` and `odoo-web-data` in the docker-compose.yml) store all your critical data. By default, these live in `/var/lib/docker/volumes/` with no backup. A simple `docker compose down -v` (with the -v flag) will DELETE YOUR ENTIRE DATABASE. Set up automated daily backups to Vultr Block Storage or S3. Use the AriaShaw backup scripts referenced at the end of this guide. At minimum, run `docker exec odoo-db pg_dump -U odoo -d production > backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).sql` daily via cron and copy the file offsite. Test your restore procedure before you need it.

  troubleshooting_guide: |
    **Problem: Odoo container keeps restarting in a loop**

    Check logs: `docker compose logs odoo-web --tail 100`. Common causes:

    1. **Database connection failure**: If you see "FATAL: password authentication failed for user odoo", your .env file credentials don't match. Verify: `docker compose exec odoo-db psql -U odoo -d postgres -c '\du'` shows the correct username. Reset password: `docker compose exec odoo-db psql -U postgres -c "ALTER USER odoo WITH PASSWORD 'newpassword';"` and update `.env`.

    2. **Out of memory**: Check `docker stats odoo-web`. If memory usage hits limit-memory-hard (2.5GB in our config), reduce worker count. For 2GB instances, use `--workers=3` instead of 5 and set `--limit-memory-hard=1610612736` (1.5GB).

    3. **Port conflict**: Another service might be using port 8069. Check: `netstat -tulpn | grep 8069`. If occupied, either stop the conflicting service or change Odoo's port in docker-compose.yml to `127.0.0.1:8070:8069`.

    **Problem: Can't access Odoo via HTTPS (browser shows "connection refused")**

    Systematic check:

    1. **Verify Nginx is running**: `systemctl status nginx`. If not active, check error log: `journalctl -u nginx -n 50`. Common issue: syntax error in `/etc/nginx/sites-available/odoo`. Test config: `nginx -t`.

    2. **Check Vultr firewall**: Log into Vultr dashboard, verify firewall group attached to your instance allows port 443 from 0.0.0.0/0. Firewall rules take 60-90 seconds to propagate.

    3. **Verify DNS resolution**: From your local machine, run `nslookup yourdomain.com`. Should show your Vultr server IP. If not, DNS hasn't propagated yet—wait 1-6 hours.

    4. **Check SSL certificate**: `certbot certificates` should show your domain with a valid expiry date. If certificate is missing, re-run: `certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com`.

    5. **Test from server**: SSH into server and run `curl -I http://localhost:8069/web`. Should return 200 OK. If this works but external HTTPS doesn't, issue is in Nginx proxy configuration.

    **Problem: Odoo is very slow (5+ seconds per page load)**

    Performance diagnosis:

    1. **Check PostgreSQL stats**: `docker exec odoo-db psql -U odoo -d production -c 'SELECT datname, numbackends, xact_commit, xact_rollback, blks_read, blks_hit FROM pg_stat_database WHERE datname = '\''production'\'';'`. If `blks_read` is high relative to `blks_hit`, you need more shared_buffers. Run the tuning script from this guide.

    2. **Identify slow queries**: `docker exec odoo-db psql -U odoo -d postgres -c 'SELECT query, calls, total_time/calls as avg_time_ms FROM pg_stat_statements ORDER BY total_time DESC LIMIT 10;'`. Queries averaging >100ms need optimization (add indexes or rewrite logic).

    3. **Check worker utilization**: `docker compose logs odoo-web | grep "worker"`. If you see many "worker X processing request" messages with same worker ID repeatedly, you need more workers. Increase `--workers` setting or upgrade to larger Vultr instance.

    4. **Monitor resource usage**: `docker stats`. If CPU is consistently >80% on odoo-web, you're CPU-bound—upgrade instance. If PostgreSQL memory is near limit, increase shared_buffers. If disk I/O wait is high, consider Vultr's Block Storage for database volume.

    5. **Check for session storage bottleneck**: If you're using default PostgreSQL session storage, sessions table gets bloated. Switch to filesystem storage: add `--session-storage=filesystem` to docker-compose.yml Odoo command, then `docker compose restart odoo-web`.

    **Problem: Let's Encrypt certificate renewal fails**

    Run `certbot renew --dry-run` to see the exact error. Common issues:

    1. **Port 80 blocked**: Let's Encrypt HTTP-01 validation requires port 80 open. Check Vultr firewall allows 0.0.0.0/0 on port 80. Check Nginx: `curl http://yourdomain.com/.well-known/acme-challenge/test` should NOT return 404.

    2. **Nginx redirect too aggressive**: If your Nginx config redirects ALL port 80 traffic to HTTPS (including /.well-known), Certbot validation fails. Ensure you have exception: `location /.well-known/acme-challenge/ { root /var/www/html; }` BEFORE the redirect rule.

    3. **Rate limiting**: Let's Encrypt limits 50 certificates per domain per week. Check recent attempts: `certbot certificates`. If you hit limit, wait 7 days or use staging environment for testing: `certbot --staging`.

    **Problem: Odoo database manager accessible in production**

    This is a critical security issue. Visit `https://yourdomain.com/web/database/manager`. If you see the database manager interface, your Nginx config isn't blocking it. Add this to your Nginx server block:

    ```nginx
    location ~* /web/database {
        deny all;
        return 403;
    }
    ```

    Reload Nginx: `systemctl reload nginx`. Test again—you should get 403 Forbidden. Alternative: In Odoo config, set `list_db = False` to hide database selector, but Nginx blocking is more secure.

    **Problem: File uploads fail with "413 Request Entity Too Large"**

    Nginx's default client_max_body_size is 1MB. For Odoo document uploads, this is too small. Edit `/etc/nginx/sites-available/odoo` and add inside the `server` block:

    ```nginx
    client_max_body_size 100M;  # Adjust based on your needs
    ```

    Reload Nginx: `systemctl reload nginx`. Also check Odoo's limit: `--limit-request=8192` in docker-compose.yml allows 8MB request bodies (header size, not file size). For larger files, increase this value.

    **Problem: Can't connect to Odoo after server reboot**

    Docker containers should auto-start due to `restart: unless-stopped` policy. If they don't:

    1. **Check Docker service**: `systemctl status docker`. If not running, start it: `systemctl start docker && systemctl enable docker`.

    2. **Check container status**: `docker compose ps`. If containers show "Exited", view exit code: `docker compose ps -a`. Exit code 137 = killed by OOM, reduce memory limits. Exit code 1 = application error, check logs.

    3. **Manually restart**: `cd /opt/odoo && docker compose up -d`. If this works, issue might be boot order—database container starts before network is ready. Add delay: create `/etc/systemd/system/docker-compose-odoo.service` with dependency on network-online.target.

  migration_from_manual_install: |
    **When to Use This Migration Path**

    If you currently have Odoo 18 running on Vultr using a manual installation (installed via apt, pip, or source code), migrating to Docker Compose offers significant operational benefits: simplified updates, isolated dependencies, easier rollback, and standardized configuration. This migration guide assumes your current setup uses PostgreSQL on the same server and you have SSH root access.

    **Pre-Migration Checklist (15 minutes)**

    Before making any changes, document your current setup:

    1. **Identify Odoo installation path**: Typically `/opt/odoo` or `/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/odoo`. Find it: `ps aux | grep odoo-bin` shows the running process path.

    2. **Locate configuration file**: Usually `/etc/odoo/odoo.conf` or `/opt/odoo/.odoorc`. Verify with: `grep config /etc/systemd/system/odoo.service`.

    3. **List custom addons**: Check `addons_path` in odoo.conf. Note any directories outside the main Odoo installation (these are your custom modules).

    4. **Document database details**: From odoo.conf, note `db_host`, `db_port`, `db_user`, `db_password`, and `db_name`. You'll need these for migration.

    5. **Check current resource usage**: Run `htop` and note Odoo's memory usage and worker count. This helps size your Docker containers appropriately.

    **Step 1: Create Full Backup (10 minutes)**

    Critical: Do NOT skip this step. Backups are your rollback strategy if migration fails.

    Stop Odoo service: `systemctl stop odoo`. This prevents data corruption during backup.

    Backup PostgreSQL database:
    ```bash
    sudo -u postgres pg_dump -Fc -d odoo_production > /root/odoo_db_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).dump
    ```

    Backup Odoo filestore (uploaded files):
    ```bash
    tar -czf /root/odoo_filestore_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz /opt/odoo/.local/share/Odoo/filestore/
    # Or find filestore path with: sudo -u odoo odoo-bin --stop-after-init --data-dir=/var/lib/odoo
    ```

    Backup custom addons:
    ```bash
    tar -czf /root/odoo_custom_addons_$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz /opt/odoo/custom_addons/
    # Adjust path based on your addons_path from odoo.conf
    ```

    Backup configuration file:
    ```bash
    cp /etc/odoo/odoo.conf /root/odoo.conf.backup
    ```

    Verify backup file sizes are reasonable (not 0 bytes): `ls -lh /root/*backup*`. Copy backups to your local machine or cloud storage: `scp root@your-vultr-ip:/root/*backup* ./local-backup/`.

    **Step 2: Install Docker and Docker Compose (5 minutes)**

    Your manual Odoo installation likely didn't include Docker. Follow Step 3 from this guide's main deployment instructions to install Docker Engine and Docker Compose v2.

    **Step 3: Set Up Docker Environment (10 minutes)**

    Create Docker project directory:
    ```bash
    mkdir -p /opt/odoo-docker/{addons,config}
    cd /opt/odoo-docker
    ```

    Copy custom addons to Docker mount point:
    ```bash
    cp -r /opt/odoo/custom_addons/* /opt/odoo-docker/addons/
    chown -R 101:101 /opt/odoo-docker/addons/  # Odoo container runs as UID 101
    ```

    Create docker-compose.yml using the configuration from this guide's `docker_compose_generator` section. Save it as `/opt/odoo-docker/docker-compose.yml`.

    Create .env file with your existing database credentials:
    ```bash
    cat > /opt/odoo-docker/.env <<EOF
    POSTGRES_DB=odoo_production
    POSTGRES_USER=your_existing_db_user
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_existing_db_password
    ODOO_ADMIN_PASSWD=$(openssl rand -base64 24)
    EOF
    chmod 600 /opt/odoo-docker/.env
    ```

    **Step 4: Migrate Database to Docker PostgreSQL (15 minutes)**

    Start only the PostgreSQL container:
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d odoo-db
    docker compose logs odoo-db  # Wait for "database system is ready to accept connections"
    ```

    Restore your backup into the Docker PostgreSQL container:
    ```bash
    cat /root/odoo_db_backup_*.dump | docker exec -i odoo-db pg_restore -U odoo -d odoo_production -v
    ```

    If you encounter "database does not exist", create it first:
    ```bash
    docker exec odoo-db psql -U odoo -d postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE odoo_production;"
    ```

    Verify data restored successfully:
    ```bash
    docker exec odoo-db psql -U odoo -d odoo_production -c "SELECT count(*) FROM res_users;"
    # Should show your user count, not 0
    ```

    **Step 5: Migrate Filestore (5 minutes)**

    The Odoo filestore (uploaded attachments, images) needs to be moved into the Docker volume. First, extract your backup:
    ```bash
    mkdir /tmp/filestore_restore
    tar -xzf /root/odoo_filestore_backup_*.tar.gz -C /tmp/filestore_restore
    ```

    Start Odoo container to create volume structure:
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d odoo-web
    docker compose stop odoo-web  # Stop it again
    ```

    Copy filestore into Docker volume:
    ```bash
    docker run --rm -v odoo-docker_odoo-web-data:/target -v /tmp/filestore_restore:/source alpine cp -r /source/filestore /target/.local/share/Odoo/
    ```

    Verify ownership:
    ```bash
    docker run --rm -v odoo-docker_odoo-web-data:/data alpine chown -R 101:101 /data/.local/share/Odoo/filestore
    ```

    **Step 6: Configure Nginx Reverse Proxy (10 minutes)**

    If your manual installation already has Nginx, you need to update the upstream configuration. Edit `/etc/nginx/sites-available/odoo` (or whatever your config is named):

    Change the upstream block from:
    ```nginx
    upstream odoo {
        server 127.0.0.1:8069;  # Your old Odoo instance
    }
    ```

    To:
    ```nginx
    upstream odoo {
        server 127.0.0.1:8069;  # Docker Odoo instance (same port, different process)
    }
    ```

    Actually, if your port is still 8069, no change needed! Just ensure your docker-compose.yml exposes Odoo on the same port. If your old setup used a different port, adjust the docker-compose.yml ports mapping: `- "127.0.0.1:OLD_PORT:8069"`.

    Test Nginx config: `nginx -t`. If successful, reload: `systemctl reload nginx`.

    **Step 7: Disable Old Odoo Service and Start Docker Containers (5 minutes)**

    Prevent old Odoo from starting on boot:
    ```bash
    systemctl disable odoo
    systemctl stop odoo
    ```

    Start Docker Odoo stack:
    ```bash
    cd /opt/odoo-docker
    docker compose up -d
    ```

    Monitor startup: `docker compose logs -f odoo-web`. Wait for "odoo.service.server: HTTP service (werkzeug) running on 0.0.0.0:8069".

    **Step 8: Verify Migration Success (10 minutes)**

    Test internal connectivity: `curl -I http://localhost:8069/web`. Should return 200 OK.

    Test external access: Open `https://yourdomain.com` in browser. You should see your Odoo login page with existing data intact.

    Login with existing credentials. Check:
    - Can you see your existing users? (Settings > Users)
    - Can you access your main database?
    - Do uploaded files/images load correctly? (test by viewing products with images)
    - Do scheduled actions still work? (Settings > Technical > Automation > Scheduled Actions)

    Check Docker resource usage: `docker stats`. Ensure containers aren't hitting memory limits.

    **Post-Migration Cleanup (Optional)**

    After confirming everything works for 48-72 hours, remove old installation to free disk space:

    ```bash
    # Remove old Odoo installation (adjust paths to your setup)
    rm -rf /opt/odoo/odoo-server  # or wherever your source install was
    apt remove odoo  # if installed via package manager

    # Keep backups! But move to archive location
    mkdir /root/pre-docker-migration-backups
    mv /root/*backup* /root/pre-docker-migration-backups/
    ```

    **Rollback Procedure (If Migration Fails)**

    If something goes wrong, restore your manual installation:

    1. Stop Docker containers: `docker compose down`
    2. Start old Odoo: `systemctl start odoo`
    3. Restore database: `sudo -u postgres pg_restore -d odoo_production /root/odoo_db_backup_*.dump`
    4. Restore filestore: `tar -xzf /root/odoo_filestore_backup_*.tar.gz -C /`
    5. Verify old setup works, then investigate what went wrong with Docker migration before retrying

    **Key Differences After Migration**

    - **Updates**: Instead of `apt upgrade odoo`, use `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d` to get new Odoo versions
    - **Logs**: Instead of `/var/log/odoo/odoo.log`, use `docker compose logs odoo-web`
    - **Restart**: Instead of `systemctl restart odoo`, use `docker compose restart odoo-web`
    - **Configuration**: Edit docker-compose.yml command arguments instead of /etc/odoo/odoo.conf
    - **Addons**: Place new modules in `/opt/odoo-docker/addons/` (mounted as /mnt/extra-addons in container)
