  skill_level_required: Intermediate (basic Linux command line knowledge)
  common_pitfalls:
  - issue: 'vultr-specific: {{LOAD:cloud_providers/vultr.yml → common_pitfalls}}'
  - issue: Odoo won't start after installation
    solution: 'Check logs: sudo journalctl -u odoo -n 50. Common causes: PostgreSQL
      not running, incorrect file permissions, missing Python dependencies.'
  - issue: 502 Bad Gateway from NGINX
    solution: 'Verify Odoo is running on port 8069: sudo netstat -tlnp | grep 8069.
      Check NGINX error log: sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log'
  - issue: SSL certificate won't install
    solution: Ensure DNS A record points to your server IP. Check firewall allows
      port 80/443.

  introduction: 'Migrating business operations from QuickBooks, Excel spreadsheets,
    NetSuite, or legacy ERP systems to Odoo requires production infrastructure ready
    before you begin data migration activities. Attempting to set up servers while
    simultaneously mapping data fields, validating import procedures, and training
    users guarantees timeline delays and increases the risk of errors that corrupt
    production data.


    This guide eliminates the guesswork that plagues most cloud deployments. You won''t
    find vague recommendations to ''choose an appropriate instance size'' here. Every
    configuration parameter includes the specific value, the technical rationale,
    and the production failure mode it prevents.'
  conclusion: 'The Deploy Odoo 18 on vultr: Complete 2025 Guide system you deployed
    demonstrates that production-grade Odoo infrastructure doesn''t require managed
    service providers or enterprise support contracts. You configured every component
    yourself—from {{ provider_name }} firewall rules through PostgreSQL parameter
    tuning to Let''s Encrypt SSL automation—and gained operational knowledge that
    survives vendor changes, price increases, and service discontinuations.


    This hands-on deployment approach delivers advantages that extend beyond immediate
    cost savings. You understand exactly how Odoo connects to PostgreSQL, how NGINX
    handles SSL termination and request proxying, where log files accumulate, and
    which processes consume memory under load. That knowledge eliminates the helpless
    dependency on support tickets and vendor response times that paralyzes businesses
    when production issues emerge during month-end financial closes or customer deadline
    pressure.


    Your infrastructure now supports the next growth phase. The vx1 instance with
    {{ recommended_instance.ram_gb }}GB RAM handles {{ recommended_instance.recommended_for
    }}, and you know exactly how to upgrade to larger instance types when user counts
    exceed current capacity. The automated backup system protects against data loss.
    The monitoring foundation provides visibility into system health. You built infrastructure
    that serves business needs for years, not months—that durability and control define
    digital sovereignty.

    '
  deployment_guide: 'The first decision determines your cost structure for the next
    year: which instance type matches your workload without overprovisioning. The
    t3.medium offers 2 vCPUs and 4GB RAM at $30.37 monthly on-demand, suitable for
    businesses with 10-30 users running standard Odoo modules like Sales, CRM, and
    Inventory. If your team exceeds 30 users or you''re deploying manufacturing or
    accounting modules with complex calculations, the m6i.large provides 8GB RAM at
    $89.28 monthly, which prevents the memory-swap thrashing that kills Odoo responsiveness
    under load. The wildcard option is the t4g.medium, an ARM-based Graviton instance
    at $24.30 monthly that delivers identical specs to the t3.medium but costs 20%
    less.


    Launch your chosen instance through {{Load:Cloud_Providers/Vultr.Yml}}''s console
    with Ubuntu 24.04 LTS as the base image. AWS provides official Ubuntu AMIs updated
    monthly, eliminating the malware-laden AMI risk that plagues community images.
    During launch configuration, create a new key pair for SSH access and download
    the private key immediately—AWS doesn''t store it, and you''ll need it for every
    future access.


    Security group configuration requires precision, not paranoia. Create a new security
    group with four inbound rules: SSH (port 22) restricted to your office IP address
    or VPN endpoint, HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) open to 0.0.0.0/0 for public
    access, and port 8069 open to 0.0.0.0/0 temporarily during initial setup. After
    SSL works, delete the 8069 rule entirely. Many guides leave it open permanently,
    creating an unencrypted access vector that bypasses your HTTPS enforcement.


    Connect via SSH and begin the installation phase. You face a fundamental architecture
    choice: Docker Compose or native installation. Docker Compose offers faster initial
    deployment and easier version upgrades—you change one line in a docker-compose.yml
    file and restart containers. Native installation gives you deeper control over
    Python dependencies and system-level optimizations, plus it avoids the 10-15%
    performance overhead Docker networking layers introduce. For most {{Load:Cloud_Providers/Vultr.Yml}}
    deployments, native installation makes sense because you''re already managing
    infrastructure—you''ve chosen {{Load:Cloud_Providers/Vultr.Yml}} over managed
    hosting precisely to maximize control.


    Install PostgreSQL 16 locally first with apt, then add the Odoo {{LOAD:odoo_versions/odoo_18.yml}}
    repository, install the odoo package, and configure it to bind to localhost only
    while you test functionality.


    The PostgreSQL decision carries operational weight. Self-hosting PostgreSQL on
    the same instance simplifies the architecture and eliminates additional database
    costs, but puts database administration on your team. You''ll handle vacuum operations,
    index optimization, and backup verification yourself. RDS managed PostgreSQL removes
    those responsibilities and adds automated backups with point-in-time recovery,
    but introduces 2-4ms network latency between Odoo and the database that impacts
    report generation and bulk import operations. If your team lacks a database specialist
    and your Odoo instance handles under 100 concurrent users, RDS is the pragmatic
    choice. Launch a db.t3.micro with 20GB storage and enable automated backups with
    a 7-day retention window.


    SSL termination through Let''s Encrypt provides free certificates with automated
    renewal, but requires a reverse proxy. Install Nginx, create a server block that
    proxies requests from port 443 to Odoo''s port 8069, and run Certbot to obtain
    certificates for your domain. The critical configuration detail most guides omit:
    set proxy_read_timeout to 600 seconds in your Nginx server block. Odoo''s module
    installation and large report generation operations can take several minutes,
    and Nginx''s default 60-second timeout kills these requests prematurely, generating
    cryptic "bad gateway" errors.


    AWS-specific optimizations start with EBS volume tuning. Enable EBS optimization
    on your EC2 instance through the console, which dedicates network bandwidth to
    storage traffic and prevents disk I/O from competing with Odoo''s HTTP traffic.
    Attach an IAM role to the instance with CloudWatch agent permissions, install
    the CloudWatch agent, and configure it to stream Odoo''s log files to CloudWatch
    Logs.


    The Reserved Instance decision happens after you validate the deployment. Run
    on-demand pricing for the first month while you confirm the instance size handles
    your actual workload and user count. Once you''ve settled on the right size, purchase
    a one-year reserved instance through the EC2 console—you''ll pay the full year
    upfront or choose monthly payments at a slight premium. The 36% savings compounds
    monthly, totaling $133 annually for a t3.medium reservation.


    The total monthly {{Load:Cloud_Providers/Vultr.Yml}} cost for a production Odoo
    {{LOAD:odoo_versions/odoo_18.yml}} deployment runs approximately $30-50. This
    includes compute, storage, and data transfer costs.
