    changes. Follow each step precisely, and you will conquer the Odoo deployment
    challenges that trap many administrators.'
  main_content: '## System Preparation and Dependency Installation


    ### Rocky Linux 9 Base System Configuration


    Begin with a comprehensive system update. This process ensures all existing packages
    receive the latest security patches and bug fixes. Run `dnf update -y` to refresh
    your package cache and upgrade installed software. Reboot the server if the kernel
    receives an update. A current system prevents conflicts with newer dependencies
    that Odoo 18 requires.


    Configure SELinux for enforcement mode. Odoo operates within strict security contexts.
    Install the necessary management tools with `dnf install -y policycoreutils-python-utils`.
    Set SELinux to enforcing using `setenforce 1` and modify `/etc/selinux/config`
    for persistence across reboots. These measures protect your system from unauthorized
    access attempts.


    Open the required firewall ports for initial access. Odoo needs port 80 for HTTP
    and port 443 for HTTPS traffic. Execute `firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=80/tcp`
    and `firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=443/tcp`. Reload the firewall configuration
    with `firewall-cmd --reload`. These rules enable web browser access to your Odoo
    instance after installation completes.


    Create a dedicated system user for Odoo processes. Isolating the application enhances
    security and simplifies permission management. Run `useradd -m -d /opt/odoo -U
    -r -s /bin/bash odoo`. This command creates a user with a home directory at `/opt/odoo`
    and assigns the correct system account attributes. The Odoo service will run under
    this non-privileged account.


    ### Core Dependency Package Installation


    Install the Python development tools and compilation packages. Odoo 18 requires
    Python 3.9 or newer, along with specific build dependencies. Execute `dnf install
    -y python3 python3-devel git gcc redhat-rpm-config openssl-devel openldap-devel`.
    These packages provide the compilation toolchain for Python wheels and critical
    development headers.


    Add the Node.js repository for additional JavaScript dependencies. Odoo uses Node.js
    for asset processing and management. Run `curl -fsSL https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_18.x
    | bash -` to configure the NodeSource repository. Install Node.js with `dnf install
    -y nodejs`. This step ensures you have the correct runtime for Odoo''s web client
    components.


    Install wkhtmltopdf for report generation. Odoo converts HTML content to PDF documents
    for invoices and other business documents. Use `dnf install -y https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/packaging/releases/download/0.12.6.1-2/wkhtmltox-0.12.6.1-2.almalinux9.x86_64.rpm`.
    This specific version maintains compatibility with Odoo''s reporting engine and
    includes necessary patches.


    Install additional system libraries for database connectivity and image processing.
    Run `dnf install -y postgresql-devel libjpeg-turbo-devel libpng-devel libxml2-devel
    libxslt-devel freetype-devel`. These libraries enable Odoo to connect to PostgreSQL,
    process images for product catalogs, and handle XML data transformations for various
    business documents.


    ## PostgreSQL Database Configuration


    ### PostgreSQL Installation and Initial Setup


    Install the PostgreSQL server and client packages. Odoo requires a robust database
    backend for all its operations. Execute `dnf install -y postgresql-server postgresql-contrib`.
    This command installs the database engine along with additional modules that enhance
    functionality. Initialize the database cluster with `postgresql-setup --initdb`.


    Start and enable the PostgreSQL service. Run `systemctl enable postgresql` and
    `systemctl start postgresql`. These commands ensure the database service starts
    automatically with the system and begins running immediately. Verify the service
    status with `systemctl status postgresql`. A green active status confirms the
    database engine operates correctly.


    Configure PostgreSQL authentication for the Odoo user. Switch to the postgres
    system account with `su - postgres`. Create a dedicated database user for Odoo
    using `createuser --createdb --username postgres --no-createrole --no-superuser
    --pwprompt odoo`. Enter a strong password when prompted. This user will own all
    Odoo database instances.


    Modify PostgreSQL''s host-based authentication rules. Edit the `/var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf`
    file. Locate the lines for local connections and change the authentication method
    from ident to md5. This adjustment allows password-based authentication for local
    connections. Restart PostgreSQL with `systemctl restart postgresql` to apply the
    changes.


    ### Database Security and Performance Tuning


    Adjust PostgreSQL configuration for better performance. Edit `/var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf`.
    Increase the `max_connections` parameter to 80, as Odoo can require numerous database
    connections under load. Set `shared_buffers` to 25% of your system''s available
    RAM. These modifications help the database handle concurrent Odoo users without
    performance degradation.


    Create the first Odoo database instance. As the postgres user, run `createdb --owner=odoo
    odoo-prod`. This command creates a production database owned by the Odoo user.
    Test the connection with `psql --username=odoo --password odoo-prod`. Successful
    login confirms the database setup completes correctly before proceeding to Odoo
    installation.


    Configure connection limits and resource constraints. Execute `ALTER USER odoo
    WITH CONNECTION LIMIT 75;` within the PostgreSQL prompt. This restriction prevents
    the database user from exhausting all available connections. Consider setting
    statement timeouts for long-running queries with `ALTER DATABASE odoo-prod SET
    statement_timeout = ''30s'';`. These measures protect database stability.


    Implement regular backup procedures. Configure pg_dump in a cron job for daily
    database backups. Create a script at `/usr/local/bin/odoo-backup.sh` that executes
    `pg_dump --username=odoo odoo-prod > /backup/odoo-$(date +%Y%m%d).sql`. Secure
    the backup directory with proper permissions. Regular backups provide recovery
    options in case of data corruption or system failure.


    ## Odoo 18 Application Installation


    ### Python Environment and Source Code Deployment


    Create an isolated Python virtual environment. This approach prevents conflicts
    with system Python packages and ensures dependency consistency. Run `python3 -m
    venv /opt/odoo/venv` as the odoo user. Activate the environment with `source /opt/odoo/venv/bin/activate`.
    Your command prompt will change, indicating the virtual environment activates
    successfully.


    Install Odoo 18 dependencies using pip. The requirements.txt file specifies exact
    versions for compatibility. Execute `/opt/odoo/venv/bin/pip3 install wheel`. Then
    install the core dependencies with `/opt/odoo/venv/bin/pip3 install -r /opt/odoo/odoo/requirements.txt`.
    This process compiles and installs all necessary Python packages for Odoo operation.


    Download the Odoo 18 source code from the official repository. Change to the odoo
    user with `su - odoo`. Clone the source code using `git clone https://github.com/odoo/odoo.git
    /opt/odoo/odoo --branch 18.0 --depth=1`. The depth parameter limits the download
    to the latest commit, reducing bandwidth usage and storage requirements.


    Verify the installation by testing the Odoo command-line interface. Run `/opt/odoo/venv/bin/python3
    /opt/odoo/odoo/odoo-bin --help` while the virtual environment activates. The command
    should display help information about available options and parameters. This confirmation
    validates the core installation completes without errors.


    ### Application Configuration and Service Setup


    Create the Odoo configuration file. Switch to the odoo user and navigate to the
    home directory. Generate a new configuration template using `/opt/odoo/venv/bin/python3
    /opt/odoo/odoo/odoo-bin --save --stop-after-init`. This command creates `/opt/odoo/.odoorc`
    with default settings. We will modify this file with our specific production values.


    Edit the Odoo configuration for production use. Open `/opt/odoo/.odoorc` in a
    text editor. Set critical parameters including the database host, port, and user
    credentials. Configure the addons path to include both core modules and custom
    development directories. Specify the admin password for database creation and
    management functions.


    Create a systemd service file for Odoo. As root, create `/etc/systemd/system/odoo.service`.
    This file defines the service execution parameters, including the user context,
    environment variables, and executable path. Set proper resource limits and restart
    behavior to ensure high availability. The service file integrates Odoo with Rocky
    Linux''s init system.


    Configure logging and process management. The systemd service directs standard
    output to journald for centralized logging. Specify log rotation policies in the
    Odoo configuration file to prevent disk space exhaustion. Set the log level to
    appropriate values for production (typically info or warn). These measures provide
    visibility into system operation and simplify troubleshooting.


    ## Nginx Reverse Proxy and SSL Configuration


    ### Nginx Installation and Basic Setup


    Install the Nginx web server package. Execute `dnf install -y nginx` as the root
    user. This command installs the latest stable version of Nginx from the Rocky
    Linux repositories. Start and enable the service with `systemctl enable nginx`
    and `systemctl start nginx`. Verify the installation by accessing your server''s
    IP address in a web browser.


    Configure Nginx as a reverse proxy for Odoo. Create a new configuration file at
    `/etc/nginx/conf.d/odoo.conf`. This file defines how Nginx handles incoming HTTP
    requests and forwards them to the Odoo backend service. The reverse proxy architecture
    improves security, enables SSL termination, and provides buffering for better
    performance.


    Set up upstream connection handling. Define an upstream block pointing to your
    Odoo instance, typically running on port 8069. Configure connection keep-alive
    settings to maintain persistent connections between Nginx and Odoo. This approach
    reduces the overhead of establishing new connections for each request, improving
    response times for users.


    Implement access control and rate limiting. Create rules that block suspicious
    user agents and implement connection rate limits to prevent brute force attacks.
    Configure client body size limits to protect against large request attacks. These
    security measures harden your Odoo installation against common web application
    threats.


    ### SSL Certificate Deployment with Let''s Encrypt


    Install the Certbot package for SSL certificate management. Run `dnf install -y
    certbot python3-certbot-nginx`. Certbot automates the process of obtaining and
    installing TLS certificates from Let''s Encrypt. This service provides free, trusted
    certificates that enable HTTPS encryption for your Odoo instance.


    Obtain and install the SSL certificate. Execute `certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com`
    where yourdomain.com represents your actual domain name. Certbot will modify your
    Nginx configuration to enable HTTPS and redirect HTTP traffic to the secure protocol.
    The certificate automatically renews before expiration through a systemd timer.


    Configure strong SSL security settings. Implement modern cipher suites that provide
    forward secrecy. Set strict transport security headers to enforce HTTPS connections.
    Configure certificate revocation checking through OCSP stapling. These measures
    ensure your SSL implementation meets current security best practices.


    Test the SSL configuration using external validation tools. Visit your domain
    with HTTPS and verify the browser displays a secure connection. Use SSL Labs''
    SSL Test to evaluate your configuration and identify potential weaknesses. Address
    any issues the test reveals to maintain a robust security posture.


    ## Security Hardening and Access Control


    ### Application-Level Security Measures


    Configure the Odoo master password for database operations. This password controls
    access to database management functions through the web interface. Set a strong,
    unique value in the Odoo configuration file. Never use default or easily guessable
    passwords, as this provides full control over all databases on the instance.


    Implement IP address restrictions for administrative access. Modify the Odoo configuration
    to only allow connections from specific trusted networks. Use Nginx''s allow/deny
    directives to restrict access to the /web/database/manager path. These measures
    prevent unauthorized users from attempting to create or drop databases.


    Secure file permissions for the Odoo installation. Ensure only the odoo user has
    write access to the configuration file containing database credentials. Set the
    ownership of the entire `/opt/odoo` directory to the odoo user and group. Restrict
    read access to sensitive configuration sections that contain passwords.


    Disable potentially dangerous Odoo features in production. Consider disabling
    the database manager interface entirely if you manage databases through other
    methods. Review installed modules and remove any unnecessary components that increase
    attack surface. These precautions reduce the risk of accidental misconfiguration
    or malicious exploitation.


    ### System-Level Security Enhancements


    Configure regular security updates for all system packages. Enable the dnf-automatic
    package or set up a weekly security update process. Rocky Linux provides security
    patches that address vulnerabilities in the operating system and installed software.
    Timely application of these updates protects against known exploits.


    Implement fail2ban for automated intrusion prevention. Install fail2ban with `dnf
    install -y fail2ban`. Create a custom jail configuration that monitors Odoo logs
    for repeated authentication failures. Configure bans that block IP addresses exhibiting
    suspicious behavior. This automated response mitigates brute force attacks.


    Set up comprehensive firewall rules. Beyond the basic web ports, restrict SSH
    access to specific management networks. Close all unnecessary ports to reduce
    the system''s attack surface. Use firewall-cmd to make these rules permanent so
    they persist across reboots and service restarts.


    Configure filesystem integrity monitoring. Install AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detection
    Environment) to create a database of file hashes. Schedule regular checks that
    compare current file states against the known good baseline. This monitoring detects
    unauthorized changes to critical system and application files.


    ## Performance Optimization and Monitoring


    ### Database and Application Tuning


    Optimize PostgreSQL configuration for Odoo workloads. Increase the work_mem setting
    for better sorting and hash operation performance. Adjust the maintenance_work_mem
    parameter for faster index creation and vacuum operations. Set effective_cache_size
    to reflect your available system memory. These changes improve database responsiveness
    under load.


    Configure Odoo''s built-in caching mechanisms. Enable the in-memory cache for
    frequently accessed data. Set appropriate timeouts for different data types to
    balance freshness and performance. Consider implementing a Redis-based cache for
    distributed deployment scenarios. Caching reduces database load and improves page
    response times.


    Implement worker process configuration for multi-core systems. Calculate the optimal
    number of workers based on available CPU cores and RAM. Set the limit_memory_soft
    and limit_memory_hard parameters to prevent worker process memory exhaustion.
    Configure the limit_time_cpu and limit_time_real settings to terminate long-running
    requests.


    Optimize static asset delivery through Nginx. Configure long expiration headers
    for JavaScript, CSS, and image files. Enable gzip compression for text-based content
    to reduce bandwidth usage. Set up a separate static file location block that serves
    assets directly without hitting the Odoo backend. These measures decrease page
    load times for users.


    ### System Monitoring and Maintenance


    Implement comprehensive logging and log analysis. Configure Odoo to log at the
    appropriate level for your environment. Set up log rotation to prevent disk space
    exhaustion. Consider implementing a centralized logging solution for easier analysis
    and long-term retention. Monitoring logs helps identify performance issues and
    security events.


    Set up system resource monitoring. Install and configure tools like htop, iotop,
    and nethogs for real-time system observation. Implement Prometheus and Grafana
    for long-term metric collection and visualization. Monitor key indicators including
    CPU utilization, memory usage, disk I/O, and database connection counts.


    Create regular maintenance procedures for database housekeeping. Schedule periodic
    vacuum and analyze operations to maintain PostgreSQL performance. Monitor database
    growth and plan for storage expansion before reaching capacity limits. Archive
    old records according to your business retention policies to control database
    size.


    Develop a backup and recovery testing regimen. Verify that your database backups
    complete successfully and contain recoverable data. Test the restoration process
    on a regular schedule to ensure business continuity. Document recovery procedures
    so multiple team members can execute them during an emergency.


    ## Troubleshooting and Common Issues


    ### Startup and Service Failure Diagnosis


    Investigate Odoo service startup problems. Use `systemctl status odoo` to check
    the service state and view recent log entries. Examine the full journalctl output
    with `journalctl -u odoo --no-pager`. Common issues include Python import errors,
    database connection failures, and permission problems with required directories.


    Diagnose database connection errors. Verify the PostgreSQL service runs and accepts
    connections. Confirm the odoo user exists in PostgreSQL and has the necessary
    privileges. Check the password in the Odoo configuration file matches the database
    user password. Test the connection manually using psql with the same credentials.


    Resolve module import and dependency conflicts. Examine the virtual environment
    activation and Python path configuration. Verify all requirements install correctly
    without version conflicts. Check for missing system libraries that Python packages
    might need. Isolate the problem by testing imports in a Python shell with the
    same environment.


    Address permission and file access issues. Ensure the odoo user owns all application
    files and has read access. Verify the user has write permission to the log directory
    and filestore location. Check SELinux contexts if filesystem access fails despite
    correct permissions. Use `restorecon` to reset security contexts if needed.


    ### Runtime Performance and Operational Problems


    Debug memory exhaustion and worker process crashes. Monitor system memory usage
    during peak operation. Adjust worker limits or add swap space if processes terminate
    unexpectedly. Investigate possible memory leaks in custom modules by testing with
    standard Odoo modules only. Consider horizontal scaling if resource demands exceed
    single-server capacity.


    Resolve database performance degradation. Identify long-running queries using
    PostgreSQL''s pg_stat_activity view. Check for missing indexes on frequently queried
    columns. Monitor database locks that might block operations. Consider periodic
    reindexing of heavily updated tables to maintain query performance.


    Troubleshoot email sending and receiving configuration. Verify SMTP server settings
    and authentication credentials. Check firewall rules that might block outbound
    SMTP connections. Configure proper DNS records for your domain to prevent email
    delivery issues. Test both sending and receiving functionality separately to isolate
    problems.


    Address backup and recovery failures. Verify adequate disk space exists in the
    backup destination. Check that the backup user has the necessary database permissions.
    Test backup file integrity by performing trial restorations to a development environment.
    Automate verification checks to catch backup problems early.'
