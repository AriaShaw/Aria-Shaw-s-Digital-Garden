  introduction: 'Your project management data lives in Wrike, but your business operations
    run on Odoo 18. This division creates a fundamental operational fracture. Your
    sales team closes a deal in Odoo, yet your project managers cannot see the new
    work in Wrike. Your finance department invoices a client, but the project status
    remains outdated. Your team completes tasks, yet the corresponding manufacturing
    orders or help desk tickets do not update. These silos force manual data re-entry,
    a process that consumes hours and introduces critical errors. Your organization
    loses a single source of truth for project delivery, financial tracking, and resource
    allocation.


    This guide provides a complete technical blueprint for integrating Wrike with
    Odoo 18. You will learn the precise architecture, configure the data pipelines,
    and establish resilient synchronization. We will cover the specific Odoo 18 modules
    that interact with Wrike''s API, including Project, Sales, Manufacturing, and
    Invoicing. You will map Wrike custom fields to Odoo models and handle complex
    data transformations. We will build a robust error-handling framework and implement
    security best practices for your API connections.


    Prepare for a detailed, engineering-focused process. The integration demands a
    solid understanding of both platforms'' data structures and REST API principles.
    You will work with Odoo''s ORM, web controllers, and scheduled actions. The configuration
    requires careful planning for data mapping and transformation logic. This guide
    assumes you possess administrative access to both systems and a development or
    staging environment for testing. The result will be a seamless, automated flow
    of project information that eliminates manual work and unifies your operational
    data.'
  main_content: "## Integration Architecture and Data Flow\n\nA successful Wrike-Odoo\
    \ integration hinges on a clear, event-driven architecture. You must design a\
    \ system that synchronizes data bidirectionally while preventing loops and ensuring\
    \ data consistency. The core pattern uses Odoo as the system of record for business\
    \ operations and Wrike as the project execution engine. This design establishes\
    \ a master-slave relationship for specific data domains, dictating which system\
    \ initiates changes for particular records.\n\n**Core Synchronization Patterns\
    \ and Directionality**\nThe integration follows three primary data flow patterns.\
    \ The first pattern pushes new customer projects from Odoo Sales to Wrike. When\
    \ a sales order confirms in Odoo, the system triggers a webhook that creates a\
    \ corresponding project in a predefined Wrike folder. The second pattern synchronizes\
    \ task status updates from Wrike back to Odoo operations. A Wrike webhook notifies\
    \ an Odoo endpoint about task completion, which then updates the linked manufacturing\
    \ work order or project task. The third pattern handles time and material data.\
    \ Employees log hours against Wrike tasks, and the integration pushes this data\
    \ into Odoo's Timesheets module for payroll processing and client invoicing.\n\
    \n**Odoo 18 Modules and Wrike Data Model Alignment**\nYour integration must map\
    \ specific Odoo 18 modules to corresponding Wrike entities. The Odoo Project module\
    \ aligns with Wrike folders and projects. Individual Odoo project.tasks map to\
    \ Wrike tasks. The Odoo Manufacturing module connects work orders to Wrike tasks\
    \ for tracking production milestones. The Odoo Helpdesk team can create Wrike\
    \ tasks from support tickets that require complex, multi-step resolution. The\
    \ Odoo Timesheets app collects data from Wrike time logs. You must understand\
    \ the field mappings and lifecycle states for each module pair to design accurate\
    \ data transformations.\n\n**Technical Components and Data Flow Sequence**\nThe\
    \ architecture employs several key technical components. Odoo Scheduled Actions\
    \ act as polling mechanisms for data that lacks webhook support. Custom Odoo modules\
    \ handle the incoming webhook payloads from Wrike and transform the data using\
    \ Odoo's ORM. A dedicated middleware layer, often implemented as an Odoo controller,\
    \ manages authentication, rate limiting, and error handling for API calls. The\
    \ data flow starts with an event in one system, triggers an API call, passes through\
    \ validation and transformation logic, and culminates in a create, read, update,\
    \ or delete operation in the target system. This sequence ensures data integrity\
    \ across both platforms.\n\n## Step-by-Step Configuration\n\n**Wrike API Application\
    \ Setup and Authentication**\nBegin by configuring API access in your Wrike workspace.\
    \ Log into Wrike as an administrator and navigate to the Apps & Integrations section\
    \ in your settings. Create a new API application and note your Client ID and Client\
    \ Secret. Your application needs specific scopes: wsReadWrite for project and\
    \ task data, and wsReadWrite for time tracking data. Configure the redirect URI\
    \ to point to your Odoo instance's authentication callback endpoint, typically\
    \ `https://your-odoo-server.com/auth_oauth/signin`. This setup enables the OAuth\
    \ 2.0 flow that secures all API communications.\n\nStore these credentials securely\
    \ in Odoo using the OAuth Provider menu. Create a new record under Settings >\
    \ General Settings > Integrations > OAuth Authentication. Select \"OAuth 2.0\"\
    \ as the protocol. Name the provider \"Wrike API\". Paste your Client ID and Client\
    \ Secret into the corresponding fields. Set the authorization URL to `https://www.wrike.com/oauth2/authorize`\
    \ and the access token URL to `https://www.wrike.com/oauth2/token`. Define the\
    \ scope parameter as `wsReadWrite,wsReadWrite`. Odoo will use this configuration\
    \ to obtain and refresh access tokens automatically, handling the complete OAuth\
    \ flow without custom code.\n\n**Custom Odoo Module Structure and Core Models**\n\
    Develop a custom Odoo module to encapsulate the integration logic. Create a module\
    \ named `wrike_connector` with a standard Python package structure. Define a central\
    \ model `wrike.sync.record` to track synchronization state and prevent data loops.\
    \ This model stores the external Wrike ID, the internal Odoo ID, the model name,\
    \ and the last sync timestamp. Implement the core synchronization logic in a model\
    \ `wrike.api.client` that handles all HTTP requests to Wrike, manages rate limits,\
    \ and parses API responses.\n\n```\nclass WrikeSyncRecord(models.Model):\n   \
    \ _name = 'wrike.sync.record'\n    _description = 'Wrike Synchronization Record'\n\
    \n    external_id = fields.Char(string='Wrike ID', required=True, index=True)\n\
    \    internal_id = fields.Integer(string='Odoo Record ID', required=True)\n  \
    \  model_name = fields.Char(string='Odoo Model', required=True)\n    last_sync\
    \ = fields.Datetime(string='Last Synchronization')\n    sync_direction = fields.Selection([('odoo_to_wrike',\
    \ 'Odoo to Wrike'), ('wrike_to_odoo', 'Wrike to Odoo')])\n```\n\n**Webhook Configuration\
    \ in Wrike for Real-Time Updates**\nConfigure Wrike webhooks to push real-time\
    \ updates to your Odoo instance. Use the Wrike API to create webhooks for critical\
    \ events. Your `wrike.api.client` model should include a method to register these\
    \ webhooks programmatically during module installation. Focus on webhooks for\
    \ task creation, task updates, and task deletion. The webhook target should be\
    \ a dedicated controller in your Odoo module, such as `/wrike/webhook/update`.\
    \ This endpoint receives JSON payloads and queues them for processing to handle\
    \ high-volume events.\n\n```\n@http.route('/wrike/webhook/update', type='json',\
    \ auth='public', csrf=False, methods=['POST'])\ndef wrike_webhook_handler(self,\
    \ **post):\n    # Verify webhook secret\n    request_secret = request.httprequest.headers.get('X-Wrike-Webhook-Secret')\n\
    \    if not consts.verify_webhook_secret(request_secret):\n        raise AccessDenied('Invalid\
    \ webhook secret')\n    \n    # Enqueue the job for background processing\n  \
    \  payload = request.jsonrequest\n    self.env['wrike.sync.job'].create({'payload':\
    \ json.dumps(payload)})\n    return {'status': 'acknowledged'}\n```\n\n**Scheduled\
    \ Action Configuration for Polling**\nImplement scheduled actions in Odoo as a\
    \ fallback for missed webhooks or for data that lacks webhook support. Create\
    \ scheduled actions that run every 15 minutes to fetch updated records from Wrike.\
    \ One action might query for recently modified tasks, while another synchronizes\
    \ new time entries. These actions use the `wrike.api.client` to fetch data and\
    \ then process each record through the same synchronization logic as the webhooks.\
    \ This dual approach ensures data consistency even if webhooks fail.\n\n**Field\
    \ Mapping Configuration and Data Transformation**\nCreate a user-configurable\
    \ field mapping system. Implement a model `wrike.field.mapping` that allows administrators\
    \ to define how Wrike custom fields correspond to Odoo fields. This model stores\
    \ the Wrike field ID, the Odoo model, the Odoo field name, and any required data\
    \ transformation. Use this mapping during synchronization to automatically convert\
    \ values between the two systems' formats, handling data type differences and\
    \ value set mappings.\n\n## Data Mapping and Transformation\n\n**Core Object Relationship\
    \ Mapping**\nThe integration requires precise mapping between Wrike's hierarchy\
    \ and Odoo's relational structure. A Wrike Folder typically becomes an Odoo Project.\
    \ A Wrike Project maps to an Odoo Project as well, but with different lifecycle\
    \ states. Wrike Tasks correspond to Odoo Project Tasks. Wrike Sub-Tasks can map\
    \ to either Odoo Project Tasks with a parent-child relationship or to Checklist\
    \ Items, depending on your operational needs. Wrike Time Entries must transform\
    \ into Odoo Account Analytic Line items for proper timesheet integration and project\
    \ costing.\n\n**Custom Field Transformation Logic**\nWrike's custom field system\
    \ presents the most complex transformation challenge. Each custom field type requires\
    \ specific handling. Wrike Text fields map directly to Odoo Char fields. Wrike\
    \ Dropdown fields need value-by-value mapping to Odoo Selection fields. Wrike\
    \ Numeric fields convert to Odoo Integer or Float fields. Wrike Date fields align\
    \ with Odoo Date fields, but you must handle timezone differences. Wrike Contact\
    \ fields map to Odoo Many2one relations with the res.partner model. Implement\
    \ a transformation engine that applies these rules based on the predefined field\
    \ mappings.\n\n**Status and Lifecycle State Synchronization**\nTask status synchronization\
    \ demands careful design to prevent infinite update loops. Map Wrike's status\
    \ system (Active, Completed, On Hold, Cancelled) to Odoo's stage pipeline. You\
    \ might map \"Active\" to Odoo's \"In Progress\" stage, \"Completed\" to \"Done,\"\
    \ and create custom stages for \"On Hold\" and \"Cancelled.\" Implement logic\
    \ that only triggers a status update in the target system when the change originates\
    \ from a user action, not from the integration itself. Use the `wrike.sync.record`\
    \ model to track which system initiated the last update.\n\n**User and Assignment\
    \ Synchronization**\nUser mapping forms a critical foundation for assignment synchronization.\
    \ Create a mapping table that correlates Wrike user IDs with Odoo res.partner\
    \ IDs. During synchronization, when a Wrike task assigns to a user, the integration\
    \ logic looks up the corresponding Odoo partner and assigns the linked task to\
    \ that user. Handle cases where users exist in one system but not the other by\
    \ implementing a fallback assignment or creating placeholder users with notification\
    \ flags. This ensures task assignments maintain their integrity across both platforms.\n\
    \n**Attachment and Comment Synchronization**\nExtend the integration to handle\
    \ attachments and comments for complete collaboration context. When the integration\
    \ creates a task in Wrike from Odoo, it should upload any relevant attachments\
    \ from the Odoo record to the new Wrike task. Similarly, when users add comments\
    \ in Wrike, the integration can create corresponding messages on the Odoo task\
    \ record. Implement a bidirectional sync for these elements, but include clear\
    \ visual markers to indicate which system originated each comment, preventing\
    \ user confusion about where to respond.\n\n## Error Handling and Resilience \n\n**API Rate Limit Management and Exponential Backoff**\nThe Wrike API\
    \ enforces strict rate limits that your integration must respect. Implement intelligent\
    \ rate limit handling in your `wrike.api.client` model. After each API call, check\
    \ the `X-Rate-Limit-Remaining` and `X-Rate-Limit-Reset` headers in the response.\
    \ When you approach the limit, pause subsequent requests until the reset time.\
    \ For failed requests with 429 status codes, implement an exponential backoff\
    \ strategy. Double the wait time between retries for each subsequent failure,\
    \ with a maximum delay of five minutes. This approach prevents your integration\
    \ from overwhelming the API while ensuring eventual completion.\n\n**Data Validation\
    \ and Integrity Error Handling**\nImplement comprehensive data validation before\
    \ synchronization attempts. Validate required fields, data formats, and relationship\
    \ integrity. When creating a task in Wrike from Odoo, ensure the parent project\
    \ exists in Wrike before attempting the creation. When processing a webhook from\
    \ Wrike, verify the referenced custom fields exist in your mapping configuration.\
    \ Log all validation failures to a dedicated `wrike.sync.error` model with detailed\
    \ context about the failed operation. Provide administrators with a dashboard\
    \ to review and reprocess these errors after resolving the underlying issues.\n\
    \n**Webhook Verification and Duplicate Detection**\nSecure your webhook endpoint\
    \ against unauthorized access and duplicate processing. Verify the `X-Wrike-Webhook-Secret`\
    \ header on every incoming webhook request against a stored secret in your Odoo\
    \ configuration. Implement duplicate detection by checking the webhook ID and\
    \ timestamp against recently processed webhooks. Store a record of processed webhooks\
    \ for 24 hours to prevent re-processing the same event. If your system receives\
    \ a duplicate webhook, acknowledge it but skip processing to maintain data integrity.\n\
    \n**Connection Failure and Retry Logic**\nNetwork instability between your Odoo\
    \ instance and Wrike's API can cause transient failures. Implement a retry mechanism\
    \ for all outbound API calls. Classify errors as retryable (network timeouts,\
    \ 5xx server errors) or non-retryable (4xx client errors). For retryable errors,\
    \ attempt the operation three times with increasing delays between attempts. For\
    \ non-retryable errors, log the failure immediately and notify administrators.\
    \ Use Odoo's queue job system to handle these retries in the background, preventing\
    \ blocking operations in the main application.\n\n**Data Reconciliation and Recovery\
    \ Procedures**\nEstablish regular data reconciliation processes to identify synchronization\
    \ gaps. Create a scheduled action that runs nightly to compare recently modified\
    \ records in both systems. Flag records that show inconsistent data or missing\
    \ relationships. Provide administrators with tools to manually trigger synchronization\
    \ for specific records or projects. Implement a bulk resync capability that can\
    \ reprocess all data for a project after a major integration failure or configuration\
    \ change. This safety net ensures long-term data consistency.\n\n## Testing and\
    \ Validation\n\n**Comprehensive Test Environment Setup**\nEstablish a dedicated\
    \ testing environment that mirrors your production setup. Create a separate Wrike\
    \ workspace for testing, using Wrike's sandbox environment if available. Restore\
    \ a recent copy of your production Odoo database to a staging server, but update\
    \ all API configurations to point to the test Wrike workspace. This setup lets\
    \ you validate the integration with real data without affecting live operations.\
    \ Create test cases that cover all major business processes affected by the integration.\n\
    \n**End-to-End Business Process Testing**\nDesign test scenarios that replicate\
    \ complete business workflows across both systems. Test a lead-to-cash process:\
    \ create a sales order in Odoo, verify the project generates in Wrike, complete\
    \ tasks in Wrike, log time against those tasks, and confirm the invoice generates\
    \ in Odoo with the correct time entries. Test a support-to-resolution process:\
    \ create a helpdesk ticket in Odoo, verify the linked Wrike task creates with\
    \ the correct priority, update the task status in Wrike, and confirm the helpdesk\
    \ ticket resolves in Odoo. Document each step and verify data accuracy at every\
    \ stage.\n\n**API Failure and Edge Case Testing**\nSimulate API failures and edge\
    \ cases to validate your error handling. Temporarily disconnect your test environment\
    \ from the internet during synchronization to test network failure recovery. Modify\
    \ your Wrike API credentials to invalid values and verify the integration handles\
    \ authentication errors gracefully. Test with malformed data, such as Wrike tasks\
    \ with custom fields that don't exist in your mapping configuration. Create scenarios\
    \ with circular dependencies, like two tasks that reference each other as parents,\
    \ to ensure your integration detects and handles these edge cases.\n\n**Performance\
    \ and Load Testing**\nMeasure integration performance under realistic load conditions.\
    \ Create a test that synchronizes 1000 tasks from Odoo to Wrike and time the complete\
    \ process. Monitor API rate limit consumption during this test to ensure you stay\
    \ within Wrike's boundaries. Test webhook handling by simulating 100 concurrent\
    \ updates from Wrike and verifying Odoo processes them without data loss or corruption.\
    \ Establish performance benchmarks for critical operations and include these in\
    \ your ongoing monitoring to detect performance degradation.\n\n**User Acceptance\
    \ Testing and Validation Checklist**\nEngage business users from each department\
    \ to validate the integration meets their operational needs. Provide a detailed\
    \ checklist that covers all key integration points. The checklist should include\
    \ items like \"Sales order approval creates Wrike project with correct client\
    \ information\" and \"Task completion in Wrike updates manufacturing work order\
    \ status in Odoo.\" Collect feedback from these users and prioritize any issues\
    \ they identify before deploying to production. This final validation ensures\
    \ the integration delivers tangible business value.\n\n## Security Considerations\n\
    \n**API Credential Management and Storage**\nSecure your Wrike API credentials\
    \ using Odoo's built-in security features. Store the Client Secret in Odoo's OAuth\
    \ provider configuration, which encrypts the value in the database. Never hardcode\
    \ credentials in your custom module or commit them to version control. Implement\
    \ credential rotation procedures that allow you to update API keys without service\
    \ interruption. Use Odoo's access rights system to restrict which users can view\
    \ or modify the integration configuration, preventing unauthorized changes to\
    \ API settings.\n\n**Webhook Security and Payload Validation**\nProtect your webhook\
    \ endpoints from unauthorized access and malicious payloads. Validate the webhook\
    \ signature on every incoming request to ensure it originated from Wrike. Implement\
    \ payload schema validation to reject malformed JSON that could exploit vulnerabilities\
    \ in your processing logic. Limit the payload size your webhook endpoint accepts\
    \ to prevent denial-of-service attacks. Use Odoo's CSRF protection mechanisms\
    \ for all webhook endpoints, even though Wrike doesn't support CSRF tokens in\
    \ webhook requests.\n\n**Data Privacy and Compliance Mapping**\nAudit the data\
    \ flowing between systems for privacy and compliance requirements. Identify any\
    \ personal data transferred from Odoo to Wrike and ensure this complies with your\
    \ data processing agreements. Consider implementing field-level security that\
    \ prevents synchronization of sensitive fields like social security numbers or\
    \ financial account information. Document the complete data flow for compliance\
    \ audits, including which systems store what data and how long they retain it.\
    \ Implement data anonymization for test environments to prevent accidental exposure\
    \ of production data.\n\n**Access Control and Permission Synchronization**\nAlign\
    \ user permissions between Odoo and Wrike to maintain security consistency. When\
    \ the integration creates a Wrike project from Odoo, set the folder permissions\
    \ to mirror the Odoo project's access rights. Map Odoo user groups to Wrike user\
    \ groups to maintain consistent authorization levels. Implement validation that\
    \ prevents the integration from escalating user privileges by creating records\
    \ with broader access than the originating user possesses. This maintains your\
    \ security model across both systems.\n\n## Performance Optimization\n\n**API\
    \ Call Batching and Request Optimization**\nMinimize API calls through intelligent\
    \ batching and field selection. When polling Wrike for updated tasks, request\
    \ multiple pages of results in a single call using Wrike's pagination parameters.\
    \ Specify exactly which fields you need in each API call using Wrike's field parameter,\
    \ avoiding the transfer of unnecessary data. For creating multiple related records,\
    \ like tasks with custom fields, use Wrike's batch operations where available.\
    \ These techniques reduce network overhead and improve synchronization speed.\n\
    \n**Caching Strategies for Reference Data**\nImplement caching for relatively\
    \ static reference data to reduce API calls. Cache the mapping between Wrike custom\
    \ fields and Odoo fields, refreshing this cache only when you detect schema changes.\
    \ Cache the user mapping between systems, updating only when users join or leave\
    \ the organization. Cache Wrike folder structures and project templates that change\
    \ infrequently. Use Odoo's in-memory cache or Redis integration to store this\
    \ data with appropriate expiration times, balancing performance with data freshness.\n\
    \n**Database Indexing and Query Optimization**\nOptimize database performance\
    \ for integration-related queries. Add indexes to the `wrike.sync.record` model\
    \ on the external_id and internal_id fields to speed up lookups during synchronization.\
    \ Index the last_sync field to improve the performance of polling operations that\
    \ fetch recently changed records. Review the query plans for your busiest synchronization\
    \ jobs and add covering indexes where appropriate. Monitor database performance\
    \ during peak synchronization periods and scale your database resources to handle\
    \ the additional load.\n\n**Background Processing and Job Queuing**\nMove all\
    \ synchronization work to background jobs to maintain Odoo's frontend performance.\
    \ Use Odoo's built-in queue job system or integrate with Redis Queue for more\
    \ advanced job handling. Prioritize jobs based on business criticality—real-time\
    \ updates for task status changes can have higher priority than nightly reconciliation\
    \ processes. Implement job timeouts to prevent stalled synchronization jobs from\
    \ consuming resources indefinitely. Monitor your job queue length and processing\
    \ time to detect performance issues before they affect data freshness."
