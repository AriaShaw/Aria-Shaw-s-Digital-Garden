  upgrade_steps:
  - step: Pre-Upgrade Assessment
    commands:
    - '# Check current Odoo version'
    - odoo-bin --version
    - '# List installed modules'
    - psql -d production_db -c "SELECT name FROM ir_module_module WHERE state='installed';"
    - '# Check custom module compatibility'
    - grep -r 'openerp.osv' custom-addons/
  - step: Backup Everything
    commands:
    - '# Full database backup'
    - pg_dump production_db > backup_pre_upgrade_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql
    - '# Backup filestore'
    - tar -czf filestore_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz ~/.local/share/Odoo/filestore/production_db
    - '# Backup custom addons'
    - tar -czf addons_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz /opt/odoo/custom-addons
  - step: Set Up Test Environment
    commands:
    - '# Create test database from backup'
    - createdb test_upgrade_db
    - psql test_upgrade_db < backup_pre_upgrade_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql
    - '# Clone Odoo {{target_version}} repository'
    - git clone https://github.com/odoo/odoo --depth 1 --branch {{target_version}}
      /opt/odoo-{{target_version}}
  - step: Run Upgrade on Test DB
    commands:
    - '# Update database schema'
    - /opt/odoo-{{target_version}}/odoo-bin -d test_upgrade_db -u all --stop-after-init
    - '# Check for errors in log'
    - tail -n 100 /var/log/odoo/odoo-server.log
  - step: Validate Test Environment
    tasks:
    - Test all critical business processes
    - Verify custom module functionality
    - Check report generation
    - Test integrations (payment gateways, shipping, etc.)
  - step: Production Upgrade
    commands:
    - '# Stop Odoo service'
    - sudo systemctl stop odoo
    - '# Switch to new version'
    - sudo -u odoo /opt/odoo-{{target_version}}/odoo-bin -d production_db -u all --stop-after-init
    - '# Start service'
    - sudo systemctl start odoo

  rollback_procedure:

  - 'Drop upgraded database: dropdb production_db'
  - 'Restore backup: psql -d production_db < backup_pre_upgrade_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql'
  - 'Restore filestore: tar -xzf filestore_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz -C ~/.local/share/Odoo/filestore/'
  - 'Start Odoo with old version: sudo systemctl start odoo'

  introduction: '{{ provider_name }}''s {{ recommended_instance.instance_type }} instance
    delivers the compute and memory resources that {{ odoo_version.name }} requires
    for production deployments serving {{ recommended_instance.recommended_for }}.
    The {{ recommended_instance.vcpus }} dedicated vCPUs handle concurrent user requests
    without CPU steal, while {{ recommended_instance.ram_gb }}GB RAM provides sufficient
    headroom for PostgreSQL query caching.


    Managed Odoo providers restrict customization, charge premium rates for additional
    storage or compute resources, and create vendor lock-in through proprietary backup
    formats and limited data export options. When you deploy on infrastructure you
    control, you eliminate these restrictions while gaining operational knowledge
    that survives vendor changes and protects against arbitrary price increases.'

  conclusion: 'The Upgrade Odoo {{source_version}} to {{target_version}}: Complete
    2025 Guide system you deployed demonstrates that production-grade Odoo infrastructure
    doesn''t require managed service providers or enterprise support contracts. You
    configured every component yourself—from {{ provider_name }} firewall rules through
    PostgreSQL parameter tuning to Let''s Encrypt SSL automation—and gained operational
    knowledge that survives vendor changes, price increases, and service discontinuations.


    This hands-on deployment approach delivers advantages that extend beyond immediate
    cost savings. You understand exactly how Odoo connects to PostgreSQL, how NGINX
    handles SSL termination and request proxying, where log files accumulate, and
    which processes consume memory under load. That knowledge eliminates the helpless
    dependency on support tickets and vendor response times that paralyzes businesses
    when production issues emerge during month-end financial closes or customer deadline
    pressure.


    Your infrastructure now supports the next growth phase. The {{ recommended_instance.instance_type
    }} instance with {{ recommended_instance.ram_gb }}GB RAM handles {{ recommended_instance.recommended_for
    }}, and you know exactly how to upgrade to larger instance types when user counts
    exceed current capacity. The automated backup system protects against data loss.
    The monitoring foundation provides visibility into system health. You built infrastructure
    that serves business needs for years, not months—that durability and control define
    digital sovereignty.

    body: 'The deployment you just completed needs backup protection before you migrate
      production data. Manual backup procedures fail when administrators forget to

      backups with compression and rotation policies. The script runs unattended via
      cron, eliminating manual backup failures that cost businesses thousands in lost
