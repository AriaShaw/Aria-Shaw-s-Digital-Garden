  main_content: '## Integration Architecture and Data Flow


    ### Core Integration Components

    The Facebook Ads Odoo integration employs a modular architecture with three primary
    components. The Odoo Facebook Connector module serves as the integration hub within
    your Odoo instance. This module handles authentication, API communication, and
    data transformation. Facebook''s Marketing API and Graph API provide the external
    data sources and mutation capabilities. A dedicated background job queue in Odoo
    manages the synchronization processes without blocking user operations.


    The connector module establishes a secure OAuth 2.0 connection with Facebook''s
    API infrastructure. This authentication flow requires app credentials from your
    Facebook Developer account. The module stores encrypted access tokens in Odoo''s
    database for ongoing API requests. Each API call includes proper scoping for ads
    management, leads access, and business system user permissions.


    ### Data Synchronization Patterns

    Data flows bidirectionally through scheduled and trigger-based synchronization.
    Scheduled jobs run at configurable intervals, typically every four to six hours
    for performance data. These jobs pull campaign statistics, ad set metrics, and
    ad-level performance indicators. Trigger-based synchronization occurs immediately
    for critical events like new lead generation or conversion completion.


    The integration implements a delta synchronization pattern for optimal performance.
    Each API request includes timestamp filters to retrieve only modified records
    since the last sync. This approach minimizes API rate limit consumption and reduces
    database load. The system maintains synchronization checkpoints for each data
    type to ensure data consistency across intermittent failures.


    ### Data Processing Pipeline

    Incoming data passes through a multi-stage processing pipeline before reaching
    Odoo''s database. The validation stage checks API response integrity and schema
    compliance. The transformation stage converts Facebook''s JSON structures into
    Odoo-compatible data formats. The mapping stage applies business rules to associate
    Facebook objects with Odoo records. The persistence stage creates or updates records
    within Odoo''s ORM with proper error handling.


    Outbound data follows a reverse pipeline for operations like custom audience creation.
    Odoo records undergo segmentation based on configurable criteria. The system transforms
    Odoo data into Facebook''s required payload format. API calls execute with retry
    logic for network failures. The system logs all synchronization activities for
    audit purposes and troubleshooting.


    ## Step-by-Step Configuration


    ### Prerequisites and Environment Setup

    Begin with thorough environment preparation. Verify your Odoo 18 instance runs
    the enterprise edition with developer mode enabled. Install the Facebook Connector
    module from Odoo''s app store or source code. Create a Facebook Developer account
    and register a new application for business use. Secure admin access to a Facebook
    Business Manager account with ownership of ad accounts you plan to integrate.


    Configure your Facebook application with specific required settings. Set the app
    type to "Business" and enable Marketing API access. Add Odoo as a platform integration
    within your app settings. Specify your Odoo instance URL as the base domain for
    OAuth redirects. Generate the app secret key and application ID for the Odoo configuration
    phase. These credentials form the foundation of your secure API connection.


    ### Odoo Module Configuration

    Access the Facebook Connector configuration within Odoo''s settings menu. Navigate
    to the Facebook Integration section under Marketing settings. Input your Facebook
    Application ID and App Secret in the designated fields. Set the default company
    for imported advertising data if you manage multiple entities. Configure the automatic
    synchronization frequency based on your reporting needs and API rate limits.


    Define your default UTM parameters for campaign tracking consistency. Establish
    mapping rules between Facebook campaign types and Odoo marketing activities. Set
    cost allocation methods for proper accounting integration. Configure lead intake
    forms and assignment rules for incoming Facebook leads. These foundational settings
    ensure proper data handling throughout the integration lifecycle.


    ### Facebook Business Manager Configuration

    Establish proper organizational structure within Facebook Business Manager. Create
    a system user dedicated to the Odoo integration with appropriate permissions.
    Assign this system user to relevant ad accounts, pages, and catalogs. Configure
    lead access permissions for any forms you plan to sync with Odoo. Set up custom
    conversions for key actions like purchases or sign-ups that require precise tracking.


    Implement proper campaign naming conventions that support automated mapping. Develop
    a consistent structure that identifies campaign type, target audience, and content
    format. This naming strategy enables the integration to categorize campaigns automatically
    within Odoo. Document these conventions for your marketing team to ensure future
    compliance and mapping accuracy.


    ### Authentication Workflow Implementation

    Execute the OAuth 2.0 authentication flow between Odoo and Facebook. Initiate
    the connection process from the Facebook Connector configuration page. Click the
    "Connect to Facebook" button to redirect to Facebook''s authorization portal.
    Select the appropriate Business Manager account and grant the requested permissions.
    Facebook redirects back to Odoo with an authorization code for token exchange.


    The system automatically exchanges this code for a long-lived access token valid
    for 60 days. Odoo stores this token securely using its encryption capabilities.
    The connector implements token refresh logic before expiration to maintain uninterrupted
    service. Verify the connection status through the integration dashboard, which
    displays synchronized ad accounts and their authorization status.


    ### Data Synchronization Configuration

    Configure specific synchronization rules for each data type. Establish campaign
    synchronization to pull active and recently concluded campaigns. Set ad set synchronization
    to capture audience targeting details and budget allocations. Configure ad synchronization
    for creative assets and placement information. Define lead synchronization rules
    for immediate or batched processing of new leads.


    Implement custom conversion tracking for key business events. Map Facebook conversion
    events to specific Odoo activities like quotations or sales orders. Configure
    offline event synchronization for in-store purchases or phone sales attributed
    to Facebook campaigns. These settings bridge the gap between digital interactions
    and physical business outcomes.


    ### Advanced Configuration Scenarios

    Address multi-company configurations for enterprise deployments. Assign specific
    ad accounts to different Odoo companies based on your organizational structure.
    Configure inter-company rules for shared campaigns or consolidated reporting.
    Implement currency conversion for international campaigns spending in different
    currencies than your Odoo base currency.


    Develop custom field mappings for specialized use cases. Extend the default lead
    mapping to include custom Facebook form fields. Create specialized campaign categorization
    based on your internal marketing taxonomy. Configure automated campaign tagging
    based on performance thresholds or audience characteristics. These advanced configurations
    tailor the integration to your specific business processes.


    ## Data Mapping and Transformation


    ### Core Object Mapping

    The integration establishes precise mappings between Facebook''s advertising objects
    and Odoo''s business records. Facebook campaigns become marketing campaigns in
    Odoo with complete metadata preservation. Ad sets transform into marketing activities
    with detailed targeting parameters. Individual ads map to marketing items with
    creative assets and performance metrics. This hierarchical structure maintains
    Facebook''s organizational logic within Odoo''s marketing framework.


    Campaign mapping preserves critical identifiers for ongoing synchronization. The
    system stores Facebook''s campaign ID as an external reference on Odoo records.
    This reference enables delta synchronization and prevents duplicate record creation.
    Campaign names transfer directly with configurable prefix or suffix additions
    for identification. Budget data converts to Odoo''s currency using daily exchange
    rates for accurate financial reporting.


    ### Lead Data Transformation

    Facebook leads undergo significant transformation to match Odoo''s lead structure.
    The integration extracts field data from Facebook''s JSON response format into
    Odoo''s relational model. Standard contact fields like name, email, and phone
    number map directly between systems. Custom form fields require explicit mapping
    configuration to preserve specialized data points.


    The system applies lead assignment rules based on campaign parameters or geographic
    data. Leads from specific campaigns can route to dedicated sales teams automatically.
    Geographic information from Facebook forms can trigger territory-based assignments.
    The integration enriches leads with complete campaign attribution data for accurate
    source tracking throughout the sales pipeline.


    ### Performance Metrics Conversion

    Facebook''s performance metrics undergo unit conversion and aggregation for Odoo
    compatibility. Cost metrics transform from Facebook''s currency to your Odoo base
    currency using historical exchange rates. Engagement metrics like impressions
    and clicks maintain their original values but gain contextual categorization.
    Conversion metrics map to Odoo''s UTM tracking system with proper attribution
    modeling.


    The system calculates derived metrics that combine Facebook and Odoo data. Return
    on ad spend (ROAS) calculations incorporate actual revenue from Odoo sales data.
    Cost per acquisition metrics use Odoo''s won opportunity records as the conversion
    denominator. Customer lifetime value projections combine initial acquisition cost
    with historical purchase data from Odoo''s sales module.


    ### Custom Audience Mapping

    Odoo-to-Facebook data flows enable custom audience creation based on Odoo customer
    data. Customer segments from Odoo''s CRM module can synchronize as Facebook custom
    audiences. The integration transforms Odoo''s customer records into Facebook''s
    required identifier format. Email addresses undergo hashing to match Facebook''s
    privacy requirements before API submission.


    Product catalog synchronization enables dynamic advertising based on Odoo inventory.
    The integration maps Odoo''s product structure to Facebook''s catalog schema.
    Product variants become items within Facebook''s product feed. Inventory levels
    and pricing synchronize to prevent advertising out-of-stock items. This bidirectional
    catalog management supports dynamic ad campaigns directly from Odoo data.


    ## Error Handling and Resilience


    ### Common API Integration Errors

    The integration encounters specific Facebook API errors that require structured
    handling. Rate limit exhaustion triggers automatic retry with exponential backoff.
    Permission errors invalidate stored tokens and initiate reauthentication workflows.
    Temporary API outages activate circuit breaker patterns to prevent cascading failures.
    Data validation errors log detailed diagnostics for troubleshooting without stopping
    synchronization.


    Facebook''s Marketing API returns specific error codes that dictate response strategies.
    Error code 100 indicates invalid parameters that require request modification.
    Error code 2 signals temporary overload that benefits from retry logic. Error
    code 10 represents permission failures that need token refresh. Error code 613
    occurs at rate limit thresholds and triggers scheduled retry.


    ### Data Synchronization Failures

    Record-level synchronization failures employ dead letter queues for investigation.
    The integration continues processing other records while isolating problematic
    items. Failed records undergo diagnostic analysis to identify root causes like
    data format mismatches or validation rule violations. Administrators receive notifications
    about synchronization failures with detailed error context for resolution.


    Data consistency checks identify synchronization gaps before they impact business
    operations. The system compares record counts between Facebook and Odoo at configurable
    intervals. Discrepancy detection triggers partial resynchronization of affected
    time periods. Checksum validation ensures data integrity during transfer and transformation
    processes.


    ### Authentication Token Management

    Access token expiration follows a proactive renewal strategy rather than reactive
    failure. The integration monitors token age and initiates refresh procedures before
    expiration. Token refresh failures trigger administrator notifications with resolution
    instructions. Multi-user installations maintain separate token stores with individual
    expiration tracking.


    Business Manager permission changes require access token reauthorization. The
    integration detects permission scope reductions through API error patterns. Automated
    workflows guide administrators through the reauthorization process. Permission
    audit logs help identify unauthorized changes to the integration''s access rights.


    ### Recovery Procedures

    System recovery from extended outages follows a prioritized synchronization sequence.
    Critical data like new leads synchronize first upon service restoration. Performance
    data follows with configurable time range prioritization. The system implements
    gap detection to identify missing data during outage periods.


    Data corruption scenarios activate restoration from the last verified checkpoint.
    The integration maintains consistency markers for each synchronization cycle.
    Administrative tools enable selective resynchronization of specific time periods
    or campaign sets. Recovery procedures include data validation to ensure post-recovery
    integrity.


    ## Testing and Validation


    ### Connection Testing

    Begin integration validation with comprehensive connection testing. Verify OAuth
    2.0 authentication flow completes without errors. Confirm access token retrieval
    and secure storage in Odoo''s database. Test API endpoint accessibility with simple
    metadata requests. Validate business manager permissions across all integrated
    ad accounts and pages.


    Execute permission verification for each required API scope. Test ads reading
    permissions through campaign list retrieval. Validate leads access permissions
    through test form submissions. Verify business system user assignments to appropriate
    assets. These connection tests ensure proper foundation for all subsequent data
    synchronization.


    ### Data Synchronization Testing

    Develop test scenarios for each data synchronization workflow. Create test campaigns
    in Facebook with specific naming conventions and budget parameters. Verify these
    campaigns appear in Odoo with correct field mapping and categorization. Submit
    test leads through Facebook forms and confirm arrival in Odoo''s CRM with proper
    assignment and attribution.


    Validate bidirectional synchronization through custom audience creation. Build
    customer segments in Odoo and verify their appearance as Facebook custom audiences.
    Test product catalog synchronization by modifying inventory levels in Odoo and
    confirming updates in Facebook''s catalog. These tests confirm data flows operate
    correctly in both directions.


    ### Error Condition Testing

    Simulate failure scenarios to validate error handling robustness. Temporarily
    revoke API permissions to test reauthentication workflows. Trigger rate limit
    exhaustion by configuring aggressive synchronization schedules. Introduce network
    failures during data transfer to verify retry mechanisms. These tests ensure the
    integration maintains stability under adverse conditions.


    Validate error notification systems by generating controlled failures. Confirm
    administrators receive alerts with sufficient diagnostic information. Test failure
    isolation mechanisms to ensure problematic records don''t block entire synchronization
    processes. Verify dead letter queue functionality for manual error resolution.


    ### Performance Validation

    Establish performance benchmarks for synchronization operations. Measure lead
    synchronization latency from Facebook form submission to Odoo availability. Time
    campaign data retrieval for various date ranges to establish baseline performance.
    Test synchronization under load with multiple concurrent ad accounts and high
    data volumes.


    Validate API rate limit compliance through extended synchronization monitoring.
    Confirm the integration stays within Facebook''s usage thresholds during normal
    operation. Test bulk data retrieval optimization through delta synchronization
    verification. These performance tests ensure the integration scales with your
    advertising operations.


    ## Security Considerations


    ### Authentication Security

    The integration implements robust authentication security measures. OAuth 2.0
    flows use PKCE extension to prevent authorization code interception attacks. Access
    tokens store in Odoo''s database with field-level encryption using industry-standard
    algorithms. Token refresh mechanisms maintain security while minimizing manual
    reauthentication requirements.


    Facebook app security requires careful configuration management. Restrict app
    access to verified business associates within Facebook Business Manager. Implement
    app secret rotation procedures for enhanced security. Monitor active sessions
    through Facebook''s security center to detect unauthorized access attempts.


    ### Data Protection

    Sensitive data protection follows privacy-by-design principles. Lead data encryption
    applies both in transit and at rest within Odoo''s database. Personal identifiable
    information from Facebook forms receives additional access controls within Odoo''s
    security framework. Data retention policies automatically purge sensitive information
    after business requirements expire.


    API communication security employs transport layer encryption with certificate
    pinning. The integration validates Facebook''s API certificates to prevent man-in-the-middle
    attacks. Request signing adds additional verification for critical operations
    like custom audience creation. These measures ensure end-to-end security throughout
    data exchange processes.


    ### Access Control

    Odoo''s internal access controls extend to integrated Facebook data. Role-based
    permissions determine which users can view advertising performance data. Department-level
    restrictions can limit campaign cost visibility to authorized personnel. Record
    rules prevent sales teams from accessing competitors'' campaign information in
    multi-company environments.


    Facebook Business Manager access follows principle of least privilege. The integration
    uses a dedicated system user with minimal required permissions. Regular access
    reviews ensure permissions remain appropriate for current business needs. Audit
    logs track all data access for compliance monitoring and security investigations.


    ## Performance Optimization


    ### API Rate Limit Management

    Strategic API rate limit management prevents service throttling. The integration
    implements request queuing with priority-based scheduling. Critical operations
    like lead synchronization receive higher priority than historical reporting data.
    Request batching combines multiple operations into single API calls where supported
    by Facebook''s API.


    Intelligent scheduling distributes API consumption across rate limit windows.
    The system analyzes your typical data volumes to establish optimal synchronization
    intervals. Background job scheduling avoids peak Facebook API usage periods when
    possible. These strategies maximize data freshness while respecting platform constraints.


    ### Database Optimization

    Odoo database performance requires careful index management for Facebook data.
    The integration creates dedicated indexes on external reference fields for faster
    record matching. Partitioned storage for historical performance data improves
    query performance for large datasets. Regular database maintenance prevents index
    bloat from frequent synchronization operations.


    Query optimization focuses on the most common data access patterns. Campaign performance
    reports use pre-aggregated data where possible to reduce real-time calculation
    overhead. Lead assignment logic employs efficient queries that scale with increasing
    data volumes. These database optimizations ensure the integration maintains performance
    as your data grows.


    ### Caching Strategies

    Intelligent caching reduces redundant API calls and database queries. Metadata
    caching stores relatively static information like ad account structures and page
    details. Performance data caching with appropriate expiration balances freshness
    with resource conservation. The system employs cache warming for frequently accessed
    reports to improve user experience.


    Distributed caching strategies benefit multi-server Odoo installations. Redis
    or similar caching backends store synchronization checkpoints and API rate limit
    counters. This approach maintains consistency across multiple Odoo workers processing
    integration tasks. Cache invalidation logic ensures data accuracy while maximizing
    performance benefits.'
