  introduction: 'Migrating business operations from QuickBooks, Excel spreadsheets,
    NetSuite, or legacy ERP systems to Odoo requires production infrastructure ready
    before you begin data migration activities. Attempting to set up servers while
    simultaneously mapping data fields, validating import procedures, and training
    users guarantees timeline delays and increases the risk of errors that corrupt
    production data.


    Managed Odoo providers restrict customization, charge premium rates for additional
    storage or compute resources, and create vendor lock-in through proprietary backup
    formats and limited data export options. When you deploy on infrastructure you
    control, you eliminate these restrictions while gaining operational knowledge
    that survives vendor changes and protects against arbitrary price increases.'
  conclusion: 'You now control a production Deploy Odoo 18 on google: Complete 2025
    Guide infrastructure running on Google Cloud at $50-100 monthly—approximately
    sixty to eighty percent less than equivalent managed Odoo hosting while retaining
    full administrative access, data ownership, and customization freedom. This deployment
    gives you digital sovereignty over your business operations without requiring
    enterprise cloud budgets or dedicated DevOps teams.


    The system you built follows production-grade architecture patterns used by businesses
    operating Odoo at scale. The PostgreSQL tuning, NGINX reverse proxy configuration,
    automated backup system, and SSL certificate management represent infrastructure
    decisions that managed hosting providers charge premium prices to abstract away.
    You implemented them directly in under ninety minutes, and you own the knowledge
    to maintain, troubleshoot, and scale this system as your business grows.


    Next steps focus on operational readiness. Test your backup restoration process
    within the next seventy-two hours while the deployment steps remain fresh. Configure
    monitoring alerts for CPU utilization, disk space, and PostgreSQL connection counts.
    Document your specific configuration decisions in a runbook that future administrators
    can follow. The infrastructure foundation you established today supports growth
    from ten users to one hundred without architectural rebuilds—that operational
    leverage justifies the deployment effort many times over.

  troubleshooting_guide: '## Common Issues and Solutions


    **Issue: Odoo service fails to start after installation**


    Check the service status and logs to identify the specific error. Run `systemctl
    status odoo` to see if systemd reports configuration file errors, permission problems,
    or missing dependencies. Most startup failures trace to incorrect paths in the
    configuration file—verify `/etc/odoo/odoo.conf` contains valid paths to the Odoo
    installation directory, addons folders, and log file location. Cloud-specific
    issues often involve security group or firewall rules blocking access. Verify
    your cloud provider''s security groups allow port 8069 inbound traffic. Check
    the instance''s system logs through the cloud console for out-of-memory errors
    or disk space issues. Cloud instances with insufficient RAM (less than 4GB) cannot
    run Odoo reliably—workers crash under load, requiring instance resize.


    **Issue: Database connection errors**


    Odoo cannot connect to PostgreSQL, typically showing "FATAL: password authentication
    failed" or "could not connect to server" errors. Verify PostgreSQL is running
    with `systemctl status postgresql`, confirm the Odoo database user exists with
    correct credentials, and check `pg_hba.conf` allows local connections. The Odoo
    configuration file''s `db_user`, `db_password`, and `db_host` parameters must
    match your PostgreSQL setup exactly—case sensitivity matters for usernames.


    **Issue: Port 8069 not accessible from browser**


    The firewall blocks incoming connections to Odoo''s default port. Cloud providers
    use both network-level security groups and OS-level firewalls. Configure security
    group rules in your cloud console to allow port 8069 from 0.0.0.0/0 (or restrict
    to specific IP ranges). Then configure the OS firewall as described above. Both
    layers must permit traffic for connections to succeed. For production deployments
    behind NGINX reverse proxy, you should block external port 8069 access entirely
    and only expose ports 80/443, which NGINX proxies to Odoo''s localhost:8069.


    **Issue: Module installation fails with dependency errors**


    Odoo modules declare dependencies on other modules, and installation fails if
    dependencies are missing or if circular dependencies exist. Read the error message
    carefully—it specifies which module dependency is missing. Install missing modules
    through the Apps menu first, then retry the original module installation. For
    custom modules, verify the `__manifest__.py` file declares all dependencies in
    the `depends` list.


    **Issue: PDF generation produces blank or malformed documents**


    Cloud instances often use minimal OS images without X11 libraries. Install complete
    wkhtmltopdf dependencies: `apt install -y libxrender1 libfontconfig1 libxext6`
    (Ubuntu) or equivalent for your distribution. Verify fonts are available for PDF
    rendering: `fc-list` should show multiple font families. Missing fonts cause PDFs
    with blank characters or incorrect layout.


    **Issue: Performance degradation with increasing users**


    Cloud instance sizing matters more than on-premises servers. Burstable instances
    (AWS t-series, Azure B-series) accumulate CPU credits during idle periods but
    throttle under sustained load. Monitor CPU credit balance in your cloud console.
    If credits deplete regularly, upgrade to a general-purpose instance type. Enable
    detailed monitoring to identify whether CPU, memory, or disk I/O is the bottleneck.


    **Issue: Backup or restore operations fail**


    Cloud storage integration requires proper IAM permissions and network connectivity.
    Verify the instance can reach S3/Azure Blob/GCS endpoints with `curl` or `wget`.
    Check IAM role attached to the instance has write permissions to your backup bucket.
    For cross-region backups, ensure your bucket policy allows writes from the instance''s
    region. Test backup scripts manually before scheduling automated runs.


    **Issue: SSL certificate errors or mixed content warnings**


    Cloud load balancers can terminate SSL, making NGINX configuration different.
    If using a load balancer for SSL, configure it to forward `X-Forwarded-Proto`
    headers, and set NGINX to trust these headers with `proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto
    $scheme`. Verify the load balancer''s health checks target the correct port and
    path—failed health checks prevent traffic routing.

  deployment_guide: 'The first decision determines your cost structure for the next
    year: which instance type matches your workload without overprovisioning. The
    t3.medium offers 2 vCPUs and 4GB RAM at $30.37 monthly on-demand, suitable for
    businesses with 10-30 users running standard Odoo modules like Sales, CRM, and
    Inventory. If your team exceeds 30 users or you''re deploying manufacturing or
    accounting modules with complex calculations, the m6i.large provides 8GB RAM at
    $89.28 monthly, which prevents the memory-swap thrashing that kills Odoo responsiveness
    under load. The wildcard option is the t4g.medium, an ARM-based Graviton instance
    at $24.30 monthly that delivers identical specs to the t3.medium but costs 20%
    less.


    Launch your chosen instance through {{Load:Cloud_Providers/Google.Yml}}''s console
    with Ubuntu 24.04 LTS as the base image. AWS provides official Ubuntu AMIs updated
    monthly, eliminating the malware-laden AMI risk that plagues community images.
    During launch configuration, create a new key pair for SSH access and download
    the private key immediately—AWS doesn''t store it, and you''ll need it for every
    future access.


    Security group configuration requires precision, not paranoia. Create a new security
    group with four inbound rules: SSH (port 22) restricted to your office IP address
    or VPN endpoint, HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) open to 0.0.0.0/0 for public
    access, and port 8069 open to 0.0.0.0/0 temporarily during initial setup. After
    SSL works, delete the 8069 rule entirely. Many guides leave it open permanently,
    creating an unencrypted access vector that bypasses your HTTPS enforcement.


    Connect via SSH and begin the installation phase. You face a fundamental architecture
    choice: Docker Compose or native installation. Docker Compose offers faster initial
    deployment and easier version upgrades—you change one line in a docker-compose.yml
    file and restart containers. Native installation gives you deeper control over
    Python dependencies and system-level optimizations, plus it avoids the 10-15%
    performance overhead Docker networking layers introduce. For most {{Load:Cloud_Providers/Google.Yml}}
    deployments, native installation makes sense because you''re already managing
    infrastructure—you''ve chosen {{Load:Cloud_Providers/Google.Yml}} over managed
    hosting precisely to maximize control.


    Install PostgreSQL 16 locally first with apt, then add the Odoo {{LOAD:odoo_versions/odoo_18.yml}}
    repository, install the odoo package, and configure it to bind to localhost only
    while you test functionality.


    The PostgreSQL decision carries operational weight. Self-hosting PostgreSQL on
    the same instance simplifies the architecture and eliminates additional database
    costs, but puts database administration on your team. You''ll handle vacuum operations,
    index optimization, and backup verification yourself. RDS managed PostgreSQL removes
    those responsibilities and adds automated backups with point-in-time recovery,
    but introduces 2-4ms network latency between Odoo and the database that impacts
    report generation and bulk import operations. If your team lacks a database specialist
    and your Odoo instance handles under 100 concurrent users, RDS is the pragmatic
    choice. Launch a db.t3.micro with 20GB storage and enable automated backups with
    a 7-day retention window.


    SSL termination through Let''s Encrypt provides free certificates with automated
    renewal, but requires a reverse proxy. Install Nginx, create a server block that
    proxies requests from port 443 to Odoo''s port 8069, and run Certbot to obtain
    certificates for your domain. The critical configuration detail most guides omit:
    set proxy_read_timeout to 600 seconds in your Nginx server block. Odoo''s module
    installation and large report generation operations can take several minutes,
    and Nginx''s default 60-second timeout kills these requests prematurely, generating
    cryptic "bad gateway" errors.


    AWS-specific optimizations start with EBS volume tuning. Enable EBS optimization
    on your EC2 instance through the console, which dedicates network bandwidth to
    storage traffic and prevents disk I/O from competing with Odoo''s HTTP traffic.
    Attach an IAM role to the instance with CloudWatch agent permissions, install
    the CloudWatch agent, and configure it to stream Odoo''s log files to CloudWatch
    Logs.


    The Reserved Instance decision happens after you validate the deployment. Run
    on-demand pricing for the first month while you confirm the instance size handles
    your actual workload and user count. Once you''ve settled on the right size, purchase
    a one-year reserved instance through the EC2 console—you''ll pay the full year
    upfront or choose monthly payments at a slight premium. The 36% savings compounds
    monthly, totaling $133 annually for a t3.medium reservation.


    The total monthly {{Load:Cloud_Providers/Google.Yml}} cost for a production Odoo
    {{LOAD:odoo_versions/odoo_18.yml}} deployment runs approximately $30-50. This
    includes compute, storage, and data transfer costs.
