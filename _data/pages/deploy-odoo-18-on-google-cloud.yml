  estimated_deployment_time: 30-45 minutes
  skill_level_required: Intermediate (basic Linux command line knowledge)
  common_pitfalls:
  - issue: 'google-specific: {{LOAD:cloud_providers/google.yml → common_pitfalls}}'
  - issue: Odoo won't start after installation
    solution: 'Check logs: sudo journalctl -u odoo -n 50. Common causes: PostgreSQL
      not running, incorrect file permissions, missing Python dependencies.'
  - issue: 502 Bad Gateway from NGINX
    solution: 'Verify Odoo is running on port 8069: sudo netstat -tlnp | grep 8069.
      Check NGINX error log: sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log'
  - issue: SSL certificate won't install
    solution: Ensure DNS A record points to your server IP. Check firewall allows
      port 80/443.

  - '{{LOAD:common/security_hardening.yml → security_checklist}}'
  cost_estimate:
    monthly_server_cost: '{{LOAD:cloud_providers/google.yml → recommended_instances[instance_type].pricing.monthly}}'
    setup_cost: $0 (DIY deployment)
    ongoing_costs: Domain name (~$12/year), optional backup storage
  alternative_deployment_options:
  - option: Managed Odoo.sh
    pros: Zero maintenance, automatic backups, enterprise support
    cons: Higher cost (~$24/user/month), less control
  - option: Docker deployment on google
    pros: Easier updates, containerized isolation
    cons: Slightly more complex initial setup

  next_steps:
  - Configure Odoo modules (CRM, Sales, Inventory)
  - Import your data from existing systems
  - 'Set up automated backups (see: odoo-backup-automation)'
  - Configure email sending (SMTP)
  - Add custom domain and branding

  introduction: 'Migrating business operations from QuickBooks, Excel spreadsheets,
    NetSuite, or legacy ERP systems to Odoo requires production infrastructure ready
    before you begin data migration activities. Attempting to set up servers while
    simultaneously mapping data fields, validating import procedures, and training
    users guarantees timeline delays and increases the risk of errors that corrupt
    production data.


    The technical foundation you establish today determines whether your Odoo system
    scales smoothly from ten users to one hundred, or requires disruptive infrastructure
    rebuilds when you hit performance ceilings. Configuration decisions during deployment—PostgreSQL
    tuning, worker process calculations, NGINX timeout settings—either provide growth
    headroom or create bottlenecks that demand expensive remediation later.'
  deployment_guide: 'Deploying Odoo 18 on Google Cloud Platform requires navigating
    more sophisticated infrastructure but buys enterprise resilience. Start in the
    GCP Console at console.cloud.google.com. Create a new project, navigate to Compute
    Engine, and enable the API. The e2-standard-4 configuration with 4 vCPUs and 16GB
    RAM hits the sweet spot for 30-80 users at $98 monthly.


    Select Ubuntu 24.04 LTS as your boot disk image. GCP defaults to 10GB boot disks—increase
    to 100GB minimum for production. Choose balanced persistent disk for typical workloads.
    Firewall configuration operates through VPC-level rules. Create ingress rules
    for SSH (port 22 from your office IP), port 8069 for Odoo, and port 5432 for PostgreSQL
    if using separate VM.


    Cloud SQL represents GCP''s managed database offering and eliminates every database
    administration task. Create a Cloud SQL instance with PostgreSQL 16, choose the
    same region as your Odoo VM, select db-custom-2-8192 configuration at roughly
    $100 monthly. Enable automated backups with point-in-time recovery. Connect using
    Cloud SQL Proxy for automatic authentication and encryption.


    Install Odoo 18 dependencies, clone from GitHub, create dedicated odoo system
    user, set up Python virtual environment. Create systemd service unit for automatic
    restart. Production deployments require GCP''s Load Balancer for SSL termination—provision
    global static IP, configure backend service, request Google-managed SSL certificate.


    Sustained use discounts activate automatically. A continuously running e2-standard-4
    drops from $97.83 to roughly $68 monthly. Total costs: minimum configuration with
    self-hosted PostgreSQL costs $125 monthly, mid-tier with Cloud SQL costs $250
    monthly, enterprise with multi-region failover reaches $450 monthly.

    '
  conclusion: 'The Deploy Odoo 18 on google: Complete 2025 Guide system you deployed
    demonstrates that production-grade Odoo infrastructure doesn''t require managed
    service providers or enterprise support contracts. You configured every component
    yourself—from {{ provider_name }} firewall rules through PostgreSQL parameter
    tuning to Let''s Encrypt SSL automation—and gained operational knowledge that
    survives vendor changes, price increases, and service discontinuations.


    This hands-on deployment approach delivers advantages that extend beyond immediate
    cost savings. You understand exactly how Odoo connects to PostgreSQL, how NGINX
    handles SSL termination and request proxying, where log files accumulate, and
    which processes consume memory under load. That knowledge eliminates the helpless
    dependency on support tickets and vendor response times that paralyzes businesses
    when production issues emerge during month-end financial closes or customer deadline
    pressure.


    Your infrastructure now supports the next growth phase. The cloud run instance
    with {{ recommended_instance.ram_gb }}GB RAM handles {{ recommended_instance.recommended_for
    }}, and you know exactly how to upgrade to larger instance types when user counts
    exceed current capacity. The automated backup system protects against data loss.
    The monitoring foundation provides visibility into system health. You built infrastructure
    that serves business needs for years, not months—that durability and control define
    digital sovereignty.
