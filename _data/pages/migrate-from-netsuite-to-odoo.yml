  introduction: 'NetSuite and Odoo structure business data differently—not just in
    database schema and table relationships, but in fundamental assumptions about
    how companies organize customers, products, transactions, and operational workflows.
    Where NetSuite might combine shipping and billing addresses in single customer
    records, Odoo separates them into distinct contact types. Where NetSuite tracks
    inventory with simple quantity fields, Odoo implements multi-location warehousing
    with stock moves and lot traceability. These aren''t simple field-to-field mappings—they''re
    conceptual transformations that require understanding both systems'' data models.


    The mapping complexity multiplies with customization. If your NetSuite implementation
    includes custom fields, modified workflows, or integrated third-party applications,
    every customization becomes a migration decision point. Do you recreate the NetSuite
    customization in Odoo, or redesign the workflow using Odoo''s native capabilities?
    Do you import custom field data into Odoo''s flexible field system, or archive
    it for reference while implementing cleaner data structures? Each decision affects
    migration scope, timeline, and the risk of data loss during transformation.


    This guide provides Migrate from NetSuite to Odoo 18: Enterprise Migration Guide
    2025 field mapping templates that document the standard transformations between
    NetSuite and Odoo data structures. You will map customer records including contact
    hierarchies and payment terms, transform product catalogs with variants and pricing
    rules, convert transaction histories with proper date handling and currency normalization,
    and migrate operational data like inventory locations and supplier relationships.
    The mapping phase alone requires 1-2 weeks, but produces documented transformations
    that survive system upgrades and serve as training material for staff learning
    Odoo''s data model.

    '
  conclusion: 'Your Migrate from NetSuite to Odoo 18: Enterprise Migration Guide 2025
    deployment on your cloud provider is production-ready. The system includes automated
    daily backups with off-site storage, SSL certificates with automatic renewal,
    firewall rules that balance security with access requirements, and PostgreSQL
    tuning optimized for 8GB RAM. You can begin migrating data, configuring Odoo modules,
    and onboarding users immediately without additional infrastructure preparation.


    The deployment process you followed represents years of accumulated production
    experience distilled into ninety minutes of focused implementation. The specific
    NGINX timeout settings prevent module installation failures. The PostgreSQL shared_buffers
    calculation matches your instance RAM profile. The systemd service configuration
    ensures Odoo restarts automatically after system updates. These aren''t theoretical
    best practices—they''re battle-tested configurations that prevent the operational
    problems that plague under-prepared Odoo deployments.


    Next actions focus on application layer setup rather than infrastructure concerns.
    Install your required Odoo modules, import your data using the migration scripts
    provided in the Fortress Protection module, configure user accounts and permissions,
    and establish your backup validation routine. The infrastructure foundation you
    built today won''t require revisiting until you outgrow 10-25 users—and when that
    growth happens, you have the operational knowledge to scale confidently.



    Production security requires defense-in-depth. Access our [security hardening
    toolkit](/downloads/security-hardening-toolkit/) with automated audit scripts,
    intrusion detection setup, and CIS benchmark implementation for Ubuntu and Debian
    systems.'
  troubleshooting_guide: '## Common Issues and Solutions


    **Issue: Odoo service fails to start after installation**


    Check the service status and logs to identify the specific error. Run `systemctl
    status odoo` to see if systemd reports configuration file errors, permission problems,
    or missing dependencies. Most startup failures trace to incorrect paths in the
    configuration file—verify `/etc/odoo/odoo.conf` contains valid paths to the Odoo
    installation directory, addons folders, and log file location. Migration-specific
    startup failures often involve database schema incompatibilities. Check Odoo logs
    for "column does not exist" or "relation does not exist" errors—these indicate
    incomplete migration or incompatible module versions. Verify all custom modules
    are compatible with the target Odoo version. Disable custom modules temporarily
    to isolate whether they cause startup failures.


    **Issue: Database connection errors**


    Odoo cannot connect to PostgreSQL, typically showing "FATAL: password authentication
    failed" or "could not connect to server" errors. Verify PostgreSQL is running
    with `systemctl status postgresql`, confirm the Odoo database user exists with
    correct credentials, and check `pg_hba.conf` allows local connections. The Odoo
    configuration file''s `db_user`, `db_password`, and `db_host` parameters must
    match your PostgreSQL setup exactly—case sensitivity matters for usernames.


    **Issue: Port 8069 not accessible from browser**


    The firewall blocks incoming connections to Odoo''s default port. During migration,
    you may run both old and new Odoo instances simultaneously. Configure the new
    instance on a different port (e.g., 8070) to avoid conflicts, then update firewall
    rules to allow both ports during the parallel running period. After cutover completes,
    remove the old instance''s port from firewall rules. For production deployments
    behind NGINX reverse proxy, you should block external port 8069 access entirely
    and only expose ports 80/443, which NGINX proxies to Odoo''s localhost:8069.


    **Issue: Module installation fails with dependency errors**


    Odoo modules declare dependencies on other modules, and installation fails if
    dependencies are missing or if circular dependencies exist. Read the error message
    carefully—it specifies which module dependency is missing. Install missing modules
    through the Apps menu first, then retry the original module installation. For
    custom modules, verify the `__manifest__.py` file declares all dependencies in
    the `depends` list.


    **Issue: PDF generation produces blank or malformed documents**


    Migrated report templates may use deprecated QWeb syntax or reference removed
    fields. Test all report types (invoices, delivery orders, purchase orders) immediately
    after migration. Broken reports show XML parsing errors in logs. Recreate problematic
    reports using Odoo''s Studio or fix the QWeb templates in custom modules. Standard
    Odoo reports rarely break—issues typically come from customized templates.


    **Issue: Performance degradation with increasing users**


    Post-migration performance issues often trace to missing database indexes or outdated
    statistics. Run `REINDEX DATABASE` on your Odoo database after large data imports:
    `psql -d odoo_db -c ''REINDEX DATABASE odoo_db''`. Update PostgreSQL statistics
    with `VACUUM ANALYZE` to help the query planner choose efficient execution paths.
    Large migrations benefit from temporarily increasing PostgreSQL''s `maintenance_work_mem`
    for faster index building.


    **Issue: Backup or restore operations fail**


    Backup both source and target systems before cutover. Create a backup of the old
    system immediately before final data export, and backup the new Odoo instance
    after import but before user access begins. Store backups off-server—migration
    failures sometimes corrupt local storage. Verify backups are restorable by testing
    restoration on a separate server.


    **Issue: SSL certificate errors or mixed content warnings**


    Migrated systems may have hardcoded URLs in database records pointing to the old
    system. Search for old domain references in `ir.config_parameter` system settings
    and update to the new domain. Use SQL queries to find hardcoded URLs: `SELECT
    * FROM ir_attachment WHERE url LIKE ''%olddomain.com%''`. Update attachment URLs
    and regenerate reports that embed URLs.

  migration_guide: 'Migrating from NetSuite to Odoo 18 requires production infrastructure
    ready before you begin data extraction and transformation activities. Attempting
    to export data, build import scripts, and configure the target system simultaneously
    guarantees timeline delays and increases the risk of errors that corrupt production
    data or require complete restarts.


    The migration follows a structured four-phase workflow that balances speed with
    risk mitigation. Phase one focuses on dependency mapping and data extraction.
    Phase two establishes the Odoo environment with equivalent functionality. Phase
    three handles data transformation and import validation. Phase four manages cutover
    procedures and parallel running verification.


    ## Phase 1: Preparation and Data Extraction (Week 1-2)


    NetSuite''s data export capabilities vary by edition and user permissions. Standard
    approach uses CSV Search with 5,000 row export limit per search—large datasets
    require multiple searches with date range filters to overcome the limit. SuiteAnalytics
    Workbooks provide more flexible exports with custom joins across modules but still
    face row limits. For enterprise-scale exports, NetSuite''s RESTlet API or SuiteTalk
    SOAP API enable programmatic data extraction without row limits. Third-party ETL
    tools like Dell Boomi, Celigo, or custom Python scripts using NetSuite SDK provide
    most control for complex, high-volume exports.


    Document every NetSuite feature your team currently uses because each one represents
    a capability you''ll need to replicate or replace in Odoo. NetSuite''s SuiteScript
    customizations (Client Scripts, User Event Scripts, Scheduled Scripts) must convert
    to Odoo''s Python server actions, automated actions, or custom modules. NetSuite
    workflows become Odoo''s automated action chains and approval routing. NetSuite''s
    saved searches translate to Odoo''s filtered views and custom reports. NetSuite''s
    subsidiary structure maps to Odoo Enterprise''s multi-company architecture with
    consolidated reporting.


    Export your complete dataset including master data (customers, products, vendors)
    and transactional history (sales orders, invoices, payments). Most migrations
    import 2-3 years of historical transactions for reporting continuity—older data
    can remain archived in NetSuite for reference without loading into Odoo''s active
    database.


    ## Phase 2: Odoo Environment Setup (Week 2-3)


    Deploy Odoo 18 on production-grade infrastructure before attempting any data imports.
    The deployment guide earlier in this document establishes the technical foundation—PostgreSQL
    database, application server, backup systems, monitoring tools. Complete the entire
    deployment and verify system stability before proceeding to data import activities.


    Install the Odoo modules that match your NetSuite functionality:


    - Accounting module provides GL, AP/AR, bank reconciliation

    - Sales module handles quotes, orders, and invoicing

    - Purchase module manages procurement and vendor bills

    - Inventory module with multi-location support

    - Manufacturing module (MRP) for bill of materials and work orders

    - Consolidation module for multi-company reporting (Enterprise only)


    Configure each module''s settings to match your business processes. Payment terms,
    tax rates, fiscal year definitions, currency handling, warehouse locations—these
    configurations must exist before importing transactional data that references
    them. Missing configurations cause import failures with cryptic error messages
    about missing foreign key relationships.


    ## Phase 3: Data Transformation and Import (Week 3-6)


    NetSuite-specific data structures don''t directly map to Odoo''s data model. NetSuite''s
    sophisticated subsidiary/multi-company structure requires Odoo Enterprise for
    equivalent functionality. NetSuite subsidiaries become separate res.company records
    in Odoo with inter-company transactions and consolidated financial reporting.
    NetSuite''s custom fields and records require Odoo Studio to recreate custom fields
    and models. NetSuite''s item record structure (inventory item, non-inventory item,
    service item, assembly item) maps to Odoo product types (stockable, consumable,
    service) with Bills of Materials for assembly items.


    The transformation process converts NetSuite exports into Odoo-compatible CSV
    files or XML-RPC API calls. Start with master data in this specific order:


    1. **Chart of Accounts and Tax Definitions**: Financial configuration must exist
    before importing transactions that reference account codes and tax rates. Export
    NetSuite''s chart of accounts, map to Odoo''s account.account structure, and import
    via CSV through Accounting module.


    2. **Customers and Vendors (Partners)**: NetSuite''s customer and vendor records
    become res.partner entries in Odoo. Map contact information, billing/shipping
    addresses, payment terms, and credit limits. Handle NetSuite''s customer and vendor
    records with subsidiary assignments require mapping to Odoo''s partner model with
    company_id field set appropriately. NetSuite contact records (separate from customer
    records) become contact-type partner records as children of main partner record.
    Handle NetSuite''s category and class dimensions by mapping to Odoo analytic tags
    or creating custom partner fields.


    3. **Products and Services**: Export product catalog from NetSuite with SKUs,
    descriptions, pricing, and cost data. Map to Odoo''s product.product and product.template
    models, handling NetSuite Items with multiple pricing levels map to Odoo pricelists
    with customer or quantity-based rules. NetSuite''s matrix items (single item with
    multiple size/color options) require Odoo product variant structure. NetSuite''s
    assembly items with BOM structure become Odoo BoMs (product.bom) with component
    product.bom.line records. Handle NetSuite''s item fulfillment locations by mapping
    to Odoo stock locations within warehouses.


    4. **Transactional History**: Import sales orders, invoices, and payments chronologically
    starting from your cutoff date (typically 2-3 years prior). NetSuite''s transaction
    hierarchy (Sales Order > Item Fulfillment > Invoice > Payment) maps to Odoo''s
    sale.order > stock.picking > account.move > account.payment workflow. Export NetSuite
    transactions maintaining parent-child relationships—reference NetSuite''s internal
    IDs or transaction numbers to link related Odoo records during import. Handle
    NetSuite''s journal entries with multiple subsidiaries by creating inter-company
    entries in Odoo or consolidating at import time.


    Test imports extensively in a staging environment. Create a full copy of your
    production Odoo instance, import a small data subset (10-20 records per type),
    and verify all relationships and calculations work correctly. Fix mapping errors
    in your transformation scripts, then import progressively larger datasets until
    you''ve validated the complete process.


    ## Phase 4: Cutover and Parallel Running (Week 6-8)


    The migration cutover requires careful timing to minimize business disruption.
    Schedule go-live for a weekend or slow business period when you can afford several
    hours of downtime for final data synchronization and validation.


    Execute the cutover in this sequence:


    1. **Final NetSuite backup**: Perform a complete backup of NetSuite immediately
    before starting cutover procedures. This backup serves as your rollback point
    if critical issues emerge.


    2. **Delta synchronization**: Import all NetSuite transactions created since your
    last test import. Your transformation scripts should handle incremental imports,
    updating existing records and creating new ones without duplication.


    3. **Data validation checks**: Run comprehensive validation queries comparing
    NetSuite totals to Odoo totals. Customer count, product count, outstanding invoice
    balances, accounts receivable aging—these must match exactly. Discrepancies indicate
    import errors that require immediate correction.


    4. **User training and access provisioning**: Create Odoo user accounts for all
    staff members with appropriate security groups and access rights. Conduct brief
    training sessions covering navigation, transaction entry, and report generation
    for their specific roles.


    5. **Parallel running period**: Operate both NetSuite and Odoo simultaneously
    for 1-2 weeks. Enter new transactions in Odoo while maintaining NetSuite read-only
    access for reference. This parallel period builds confidence and identifies gaps
    in Odoo configuration or training.


    6. **NetSuite decommissioning**: After successful parallel running validates Odoo
    handles all business operations correctly, decommission NetSuite. Cancel any subscriptions,
    export final reports for archival, and establish read-only access for historical
    data queries.


    ## Common Migration Pitfalls and Solutions


    **Challenge**: NetSuite SuiteScript business logic embedded in 50+ custom scripts.

    **Solution**: Audit all SuiteScripts to identify business rules versus UI enhancements.
    Business rules (pricing calculations, approval workflows, integration logic) must
    recreate in Odoo Python code. UI enhancements often have Odoo equivalents through
    view customization. Budget significant development time for complex script conversion.


    **Challenge**: NetSuite OneWorld multi-subsidiary setup with inter-company transactions.

    **Solution**: Requires Odoo Enterprise edition for multi-company features. Configure
    res.company records for each subsidiary, set up inter-company transaction rules,
    and configure consolidation charts of accounts. NetSuite''s complex subsidiary
    accounting requires careful mapping to Odoo''s inter-company system.


    **Underestimating data cleanup effort**: NetSuite accumulates years of inconsistent
    data entry—duplicate customer records, products with incorrect categories, transactions
    with missing information. Plan to spend 30-40% of migration time cleaning source
    data before import. Bad data imported into Odoo multiplies cleanup effort tenfold.


    **Inadequate testing of edge cases**: Your transformation scripts handle common
    scenarios correctly but fail on edge cases like products without SKUs, customers
    with only shipping addresses (no billing), or voided invoices. Test your import
    process with the full dataset, not samples, to expose these issues before go-live.


    **Insufficient user training**: Power users with years of NetSuite experience
    struggle with Odoo''s different workflows and terminology. Budget for comprehensive
    training and provide job aids documenting common tasks in Odoo terms. Plan for
    productivity dips during the first 2-4 weeks post-migration.


    **Missing validation procedures**: Without systematic validation, you discover
    missing data or incorrect mappings weeks after go-live when reconstruction becomes
    impossible. Create validation checklists comparing NetSuite reports to Odoo equivalents:
    customer aging reports, inventory valuation, profit & loss statements.
