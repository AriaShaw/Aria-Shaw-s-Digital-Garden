  introduction: 'Your team loves Trello''s visual project management. Your finance
    department demands Odoo''s integrated business operations. You face a daily battle
    with duplicate data entry, missed deadlines from synchronization gaps, and reporting
    that never matches between systems. Manual card updates consume hours your team
    should spend on productive work. These disjointed tools create operational friction
    that slows your entire organization and obscures your project pipeline''s true
    status.


    This guide delivers a complete technical blueprint for integrating Trello with
    Odoo 18. You will construct a robust, automated data bridge that syncs projects,
    tasks, and deadlines in real-time. We cover integration architecture, step-by-step
    configuration with working code, complex data mapping, and enterprise-grade error
    handling. You will eliminate manual transfers and gain a unified view of project
    progress and financial impact.


    Prepare for a detailed technical build. The process demands comfort with Odoo
    Studio, basic Python scripting, and REST API concepts. Allocate a full day for
    initial implementation and testing. The investment returns substantial time savings,
    perfect data consistency, and powerful cross-platform reporting. We approach this
    as a production-ready system, not a simple plugin setup.


    Your journey starts with integration architecture. We examine how data moves between
    these platforms, design the synchronization engine, and establish the authentication
    framework. Then we dive into hands-on configuration, building the connection piece
    by piece. You will emerge with a bulletproof integration that handles real-world
    complexity and scale.'
  main_content: '## Integration Architecture and Data Flow


    A successful Trello-Odoo integration rests on a clear architectural pattern. We
    implement a hub-and-spoke model where Odoo acts as the central data hub. Trello
    serves as the collaborative front-end for project execution. This design maintains
    data integrity while preserving each platform''s strengths. The integration uses
    webhooks for real-time updates and scheduled jobs for batch synchronization.


    ### Trello Webhook Event Subscription\n\nTrello webhooks push instant notifications to your Odoo instance when changes
    occur. You configure these webhooks to monitor specific boards for card creation,
    updates, and movements. Each webhook targets a dedicated Odoo controller endpoint
    that receives JSON payloads. This event-driven architecture ensures minimal latency
    between Trello actions and Odoo updates.


    The webhook payload contains the complete card object, list information, and member
    details. Your integration must parse this data and determine the required Odoo
    operations. Common events include card creation in specific lists, due date modifications,
    and member assignments. You filter these events to prevent unnecessary processing.


    ### Odoo Scheduled Synchronization Jobs\n\nComplement the real-time webhooks with scheduled synchronization jobs. These jobs
    run at regular intervals, handling cases where webhooks fail or miss updates.
    The jobs poll Trello''s API for changes since the last sync, acting as a safety
    net. They also manage bulk data imports during initial setup.


    Design your sync jobs to process data in batches. This approach prevents API rate
    limiting and system timeouts. Each job focuses on a specific object type: projects,
    tasks, or users. The job logs each synchronization cycle for audit purposes and
    error tracking.


    ### Data Flow Direction and Conflict Resolution\n\nEstablish clear data flow rules to prevent update conflicts. Primary creation
    flows from Trello to Odoo for project tasks. Status updates and deadline changes
    sync bidirectionally with Odoo as the master for financial stages. This hybrid
    approach maintains Trello''s flexibility for task management while preserving
    Odoo''s control over business processes.


    Implement a conflict resolution strategy that timestamps all updates. When the
    systems report conflicting changes within a short window, prioritize the Odoo
    data for financial fields and Trello data for task progress fields. This logical
    separation prevents data wars between platforms.


    ### Authentication and Security Layer\n\nThe integration uses Odoo''s API keys for server-to-server communication with
    Trello. Store Trello API tokens encrypted in Odoo''s configuration parameters.
    Each API call includes proper headers and handles token refresh cycles. The system
    validates webhook signatures to prevent unauthorized data injections.


    ## Step-by-Step Configuration


    Begin configuration in your Odoo 18 development environment. Install required
    modules including ''project'', ''hr'', and ''base_automation''. Ensure the Python
    requests library is available in your system dependencies. Create a dedicated
    integration user in Odoo with appropriate permissions for project management and
    contacts.


    ### Trello API Application Setup\n\nNavigate to Trello''s Power-Up Admin page and register a new application. Generate
    API key and secret tokens. Configure the OAuth redirect URI to point to your Odoo
    instance''s authentication callback endpoint. Note these credentials for Odoo
    configuration.


    Set application permissions to read, write, and account administration. Enable
    webhooks for your application to receive real-time events. The application requires
    board read/write access and organization read permissions. Store the OAuth verifier
    token securely for the authorization flow.


    ### Odoo Custom Module Structure\n\nCreate a new custom module ''trello_odoo_connector''. Define the module manifest
    with dependencies on ''project'' and ''web''. Create models for trello.configuration
    and trello.sync.log. These models store integration parameters and audit trails.


    The configuration model holds API credentials, default project mappings, and sync
    intervals. Implement fields for trello_api_key, trello_token, and webhook_secret.
    Add selection fields for sync frequency with options for 15 minutes, 1 hour, and
    4 hours. Set up proper access rights for configuration records.


    ### Authentication Implementation\n\nBuild the OAuth flow controller in your custom module. Create routes for /trello/auth_start
    and /trello/auth_callback. The start endpoint redirects users to Trello''s authorization
    page with your API key and callback URL. The callback endpoint processes the response
    and exchanges the temporary code for a permanent token.


    Store the OAuth token encrypted in the configuration model. Implement token refresh
    logic that checks token validity before API calls. Handle authentication failures
    with proper error messages and retry mechanisms. The system should alert administrators
    when token refresh attempts fail.


    ### Webhook Configuration Controller\n\nDevelop a webhook management system in Odoo. Create endpoints for /trello/webhook/card_created
    and /trello/webhook/card_updated. These endpoints verify webhook signatures and
    process incoming JSON data. The controller extracts relevant card information
    and queues it for processing.


    Implement webhook registration that automatically creates Trello webhooks for
    authorized boards. The system should create webhooks for card creation, update,
    and movement events. Store webhook IDs for management and cleanup when boards
    disconnect.


    ### Data Synchronization Jobs\n\nCode the scheduled actions for bidirectional synchronization. Create three separate
    jobs: import_trello_cards, export_odoo_tasks, and sync_members. Each job runs
    on its own schedule based on configuration settings. The import job fetches recent
    Trello changes and creates or updates Odoo tasks.


    The export job checks for modified Odoo tasks and pushes changes to Trello. It
    handles field mappings and converts Odoo task states to Trello list positions.
    The member sync job ensures team alignment between systems, creating Odoo users
    from Trello members.


    ### Field Mapping Configuration Interface\n\nBuild a user interface for mapping Trello fields to Odoo fields. Create a tree
    view that shows Trello board lists mapped to Odoo project stages. Implement drag-and-drop
    functionality for easy configuration. The mapping interface should allow different
    configurations per project.


    Add validation that prevents duplicate mappings and ensures required fields have
    correspondences. The system should warn users about unsupported field types or
    potential data loss during transformation. Provide default mappings for common
    scenarios to speed up setup.


    ### Error Handling and Logging\n\nImplement comprehensive error tracking throughout the integration. Create a logging
    system that captures API errors, mapping failures, and synchronization issues.
    The logs should show detailed error messages, stack traces for debugging, and
    affected records.


    Build alert rules that notify administrators of repeated failures or connectivity
    problems. Configure automatic retries for transient errors with exponential backoff.
    The system should queue failed operations for manual review and reprocessing.


    ## Data Mapping and Transformation


    Data mapping forms the integration''s core logic. You must transform Trello''s
    flexible card system into Odoo''s structured task model. This requires careful
    field analysis and transformation rules. Start with direct field mappings, then
    progress to complex computed fields.


    ### Project and Stage Mapping\n\nMap Trello boards to Odoo projects. Each active board becomes a project in Odoo
    with matching name and description. Trello lists transform into Odoo project stages.
    The system should create default stages for common workflows like "To Do", "Doing",
    and "Done". Preserve the list order as stage sequence in Odoo.


    Handle board archives by marking corresponding Odoo projects as inactive. This
    maintains historical data while removing clutter from active views. The mapping
    should allow multiple Trello boards to link to a single Odoo project for complex
    program structures.


    ### Card to Task Field Mapping\n\nTransform Trello cards into Odoo tasks with field-level precision. Map card names
    to task names and card descriptions to task descriptions. Convert Trello due dates
    to Odoo date fields with proper timezone handling. Trello labels become Odoo tags,
    preserving color coding where possible.


    Handle custom fields in Trello cards by mapping them to Odoo''s custom attributes.
    Trello checklists transform into Odoo task subtasks with progress tracking. Card
    comments sync as Odoo task messages, attributing to the correct user. Maintain
    comment threading where the integration supports it.


    ### Member and Team Synchronization\n\nSync Trello board members with Odoo users and project sharing. Match members by
    email address when possible. Create new Odoo users for unmatched Trello members
    with limited access rights. Assign proper project followers based on card membership.


    Handle permission differences between platforms. Trello board administrators become
    Odoo project managers with edit rights. Regular members receive basic task assignment
    permissions. The system should respect existing Odoo security groups and not override
    manual permissions.


    ### Complex Field Transformations\n\nManage field types that require computation or lookup. Convert Trello''s relative
    due dates to absolute dates in Odoo. Transform Trello cover colors into Odoo priority
    levels. Parse Trello card URLs to extract embedded attachments and recreate them
    in Odoo.


    Handle custom field types like dropdowns, dates, and numbers. These require type
    validation and format conversion. Implement fallback values for missing data and
    truncation rules for field length mismatches. The system should log data transformations
    that modify original values significantly.


    ### Attachment and File Handling\n\nSync card attachments between platforms while managing storage constraints. Download
    Trello attachments and upload them to Odoo''s document management system. Preserve
    file names and organization. Handle large files with chunked uploads and progress
    tracking.


    Convert Trello embedded links to Odoo attachment records when possible. Maintain
    attachment permissions consistent with task access rights. The system should skip
    attachments over a configurable size limit to prevent performance issues.


    ## Error Handling and Resilience


    Production integrations demand robust error handling. The Trello-Odoo connection
    faces multiple failure points: API rate limits, network timeouts, data validation
    errors, and authentication expiry. Design your error handling to anticipate these
    scenarios with appropriate responses.


    ### API Rate Limit Management\n\nTrello enforces strict API rate limits that vary by account type. Implement request
    throttling that tracks your API consumption. The system should queue excess requests
    and process them when limits reset. Use exponential backoff for retries after
    hitting rate limits.


    Monitor your rate limit headers with each API response. Track remaining requests
    and reset times. When approaching limits, the integration should prioritize critical
    operations and defer non-essential sync tasks. Log rate limit encounters for capacity
    planning and optimization.


    ### Network Failure Recovery\n\nHandle temporary network outages with automatic retry logic. Implement a circuit
    breaker pattern that detects repeated connection failures. After consecutive failures,
    the system should pause synchronization attempts and alert administrators. Resume
    operations when connectivity restores.


    Design idempotent API calls that survive duplicate transmissions. Use unique identifiers
    to prevent creating duplicate records during retries. The sync process should
    checkpoint progress, enabling resumption from the failure point rather than restarting
    complete operations.


    ### Data Validation and Corruption Prevention\n\nValidate all data before transmission between systems. Check field lengths, data
    types, and required field presence. The system should reject records that fail
    validation and move them to a quarantine area for manual review. Preserve the
    original data for debugging.


    Implement checksums for critical data to detect corruption during transfer. Compare
    record hashes before and after synchronization to identify transformation errors.
    The integration should alert when data corruption patterns emerge, suggesting
    mapping logic issues.


    ### Authentication Token Management\n\nHandle OAuth token expiration and revocation gracefully. Implement token refresh
    well before expiry times. When refresh fails, the system should guide administrators
    through reauthentication without losing configuration. Preserve all mappings during
    credential updates.


    Detect unauthorized API responses indicating token issues. Automatically attempt
    token refresh before reporting authentication failures. The system should distinguish
    between permanent authentication failures and temporary service outages.


    ## Testing and Validation


    Thorough testing ensures integration reliability before production deployment.
    Develop a comprehensive test strategy covering unit tests, integration tests,
    and user acceptance testing. Create test scenarios that mirror real-world usage
    patterns and edge cases.


    ### Unit Test Implementation\n\nWrite unit tests for all data transformation functions. Test field mappings with
    sample Trello webhook payloads and verify the expected Odoo task structure. Cover
    edge cases like special characters in text, timezone conversions, and empty field
    handling. Mock API calls to isolate transformation logic.


    Test error handling functions with simulated failures. Verify the system responds
    appropriately to rate limits, network errors, and invalid data. Ensure authentication
    flows handle all possible OAuth response scenarios, including user denials and
    system timeouts.


    ### Integration Test Scenarios\n\nCreate end-to-end test scenarios that exercise the complete data flow. Set up
    a test Trello board with sample cards, lists, and members. Configure the integration
    to sync with this board and verify Odoo creates corresponding projects and tasks.
    Test bidirectional synchronization by modifying records in both systems.


    Validate webhook processing by sending simulated webhook payloads to your Odoo
    instance. Verify the system creates, updates, and moves tasks correctly. Test
    synchronization jobs by modifying Trello cards and running manual sync operations.
    Confirm the systems achieve consistent state after synchronization.


    ### Performance and Load Testing\n\nMeasure integration performance under realistic loads. Test with boards containing
    hundreds of cards and multiple simultaneous users. Monitor API response times
    and system resource consumption during synchronization. Identify bottlenecks in
    data processing and transmission.


    Establish performance benchmarks for synchronization completion times. Test how
    the system handles large file attachments and complex card structures. Verify
    the integration remains stable during extended operation and doesn''t accumulate
    memory leaks or resource exhaustion.


    ### User Acceptance Testing Framework\n\nDevelop test cases that business users can execute without technical knowledge.
    Create checklists for common operations like new project setup, task creation,
    and status tracking. Document expected outcomes for each test scenario. Gather
    feedback on data mapping accuracy and user interface clarity.


    Test the configuration interface with actual project managers. Verify they can
    establish new board connections and field mappings without developer assistance.
    Validate error messages provide actionable guidance for common configuration mistakes.


    ## Security Considerations


    The integration handles sensitive business data requiring robust security measures.
    Implement proper authentication, authorization, and data protection throughout
    the system. Follow security best practices for API credentials and data transmission.


    ### API Credential Protection\n\nStore Trello API keys and OAuth tokens encrypted in Odoo''s database. Never log
    credentials in clear text, even for debugging. Implement credential rotation procedures
    for periodic key updates. The system should alert administrators when credentials
    approach expiration.


    Use minimal necessary permissions for Trello API access. Request only the specific
    scopes required for integration functionality. Regularly audit API token usage
    and revoke unused tokens. Implement IP whitelisting for production API calls when
    possible.


    ### Data Transmission Security\n\nEnsure all API communications use TLS encryption. Verify certificate validity
    for both Trello and your Odoo instance. Implement proper SSL/TLS configuration
    with strong cipher suites and protocol versions. Reject insecure connection attempts.


    Validate webhook signatures to confirm Trello originated each request. Implement
    replay attack protection by checking event timestamps and rejecting old notifications.
    The system should verify webhook payload integrity before processing.


    ### Access Control and Authorization\n\nEnforce Odoo''s native permission system for integrated data. Ensure users can
    only access projects and tasks they have permission to view. The integration should
    respect Odoo''s record rules and security groups. Never bypass security checks
    for synchronization convenience.


    Implement proper authentication for all integration configuration interfaces.
    Restrict integration setup to authorized administrators only. Audit configuration
    changes and sync operations for security compliance. The system should log all
    administrative actions for security review.


    ### Data Privacy and Compliance\n\nIdentify and protect sensitive data fields during synchronization. Implement field-level
    masking for personal information if required by privacy policies. The integration
    should comply with data retention policies in both systems.


    Establish data governance rules for cross-platform information sharing. Document
    what data transfers between systems and for what business purpose. Implement data
    minimization principles, syncing only necessary fields. Provide mechanisms for
    data deletion across both platforms when required.


    ## Performance Optimization


    Optimize integration performance to handle growing data volumes and user loads.
    Focus on API call efficiency, database performance, and background processing.
    Implement monitoring to identify bottlenecks as usage patterns evolve.


    ### API Call Optimization\n\nMinimize API calls through batching and intelligent polling. Trello''s batch API
    endpoints process multiple operations in a single request. Combine related updates
    like card modifications and member changes into batch operations. Reduce unnecessary
    API calls by checking modification timestamps before full synchronization.


    Implement strategic caching for relatively static data like user lists and board
    structures. Cache board configurations to avoid repeated API calls for the same
    information. Set appropriate cache expiration times based on data volatility.
    The system should invalidate caches when changes occur.


    ### Database Performance Tuning\n\nOptimize database queries for synchronization jobs. Use selective field retrieval
    instead of fetching complete records. Implement proper indexing on synchronization
    timestamp fields and external identifier columns. Monitor query performance and
    adjust indexes as data volumes grow.


    Design efficient data transformation logic that minimizes database write operations.
    Use bulk create and update methods instead of individual record operations. The
    integration should commit transactions in reasonable batches to balance performance
    and data integrity.


    ### Background Processing Configuration\n\nImplement proper job queue management for synchronization tasks. Prioritize real-time
    webhook processing over scheduled batch jobs. Use Odoo''s queue job system to
    distribute workload across multiple workers. Scale worker processes based on synchronization
    volume.


    Monitor job execution times and identify long-running operations. Break large
    synchronization jobs into smaller chunks that process limited record sets. Implement
    job timeouts to prevent hung processes from consuming system resources indefinitely.


    ### Monitoring and Alerting\n\nEstablish comprehensive performance monitoring for the integration. Track key
    metrics including sync completion times, API response times, and error rates.
    Set up dashboards that visualize integration health and performance trends. Configure
    alerts for performance degradation indicators.


    Monitor system resource usage during synchronization operations. Track memory
    consumption, database connections, and CPU utilization. The system should alert
    administrators when resource usage approaches capacity limits. Implement automatic
    scaling where possible to handle load variations.'
