  introduction: 'You stare at your Odoo dashboard, then at your AliExpress order list.
    The numbers never match. New AliExpress orders sit unprocessed for hours while
    your team scrambles to update inventory counts manually. Product details from
    AliExpress suppliers differ from your Odoo item master. Stock levels drift out
    of sync, causing either overselling or missed revenue opportunities. Your customer
    service team fields complaints about delayed shipments while your warehouse staff
    creates duplicate work entries. These manual processes consume hours each day
    and introduce errors that ripple across your entire operation.


    This guide delivers a complete technical blueprint for integrating AliExpress
    with Odoo 18. You will master the entire integration architecture from authentication
    through error handling. I will walk you through precise configuration steps with
    actual code examples and API endpoints. We will tackle complex data mapping challenges
    specific to AliExpress product variations and Chinese supplier data formats. You
    will implement robust error handling for AliExpress API rate limits and connection
    drops.


    Expect to invest focused time in this integration. The process demands careful
    attention to detail, particularly around product attribute mapping and webhook
    configuration. You will work with Odoo''s external API framework and AliExpress
    Open Platform specifications. The technical depth requires comfort with Python,
    XML-RPC calls, and REST API patterns. Your reward will be a seamless, automated
    pipeline that syncs orders, inventory, and product data without manual intervention.


    This integration eliminates the friction between your AliExpress sales channel
    and Odoo operations. You will establish real-time order import, automated inventory
    synchronization, and streamlined product information flow. The system handles
    AliExpress-specific challenges like combination products, supplier lead times,
    and cross-border shipping data. Follow this guide to build a production-ready
    integration that scales with your business growth.'
  main_content: "## Integration Architecture and Data Flow (550 words)\n\n### Core\
    \ Integration Components\n\nThe AliExpress-Odoo integration employs a distributed\
    \ architecture with three main components. Odoo 18 serves as the central hub,\
    \ managing master data and business logic. The AliExpress Open Platform provides\
    \ the sales channel API endpoints. A custom integration module acts as the middleware\
    \ layer, handling transformation and synchronization logic. This separation ensures\
    \ that API changes on either platform don't break the entire system.\n\nYour integration\
    \ module uses Odoo's external API framework as its foundation. This framework\
    \ provides the authentication mechanism and data model hooks. The module extends\
    \ Odoo's standard sales order and product models with AliExpress-specific fields.\
    \ These custom fields store original AliExpress identifiers, supplier details,\
    \ and combination product data. The architecture maintains referential integrity\
    \ between systems without altering core Odoo functionality.\n\n### Data Flow Patterns\n\
    \nOrder data flows from AliExpress to Odoo through a pull-based mechanism. The\
    \ integration module polls AliExpress orders every 15 minutes using their Open\
    \ Platform API. This interval balances freshness with API rate limit considerations.\
    \ The system processes new orders immediately and updates existing orders with\
    \ status changes. Each order sync triggers a series of validation checks before\
    \ creation in Odoo.\n\nProduct and inventory synchronization operates bidirectionally.\
    \ Stock level updates push from Odoo to AliExpress whenever inventory counts change.\
    \ Product information flows primarily from AliExpress to Odoo during initial setup.\
    \ The system maps AliExpress combination products to Odoo's product variant structure.\
    \ This mapping preserves attribute relationships while adapting to Odoo's data\
    \ model.\n\n### Webhook Configuration\n\nAliExpress webhooks provide real-time\
    \ notifications for order events. Your integration module registers webhook endpoints\
    \ with AliExpress Open Platform. These endpoints listen for order creation, payment\
    \ confirmation, and shipment status changes. Webhooks reduce the need for constant\
    \ polling and improve order processing speed. The system acknowledges webhook\
    \ receipts within 2 seconds to prevent retries.\n\nThe architecture includes a\
    \ retry mechanism for failed webhook deliveries. Failed requests enter a queue\
    \ with exponential backoff. The system logs each delivery attempt with full payload\
    \ details for debugging. This approach maintains data consistency even during\
    \ temporary network issues or system maintenance windows.\n\n## Step-by-Step Configuration\
    \ (950 words)\n\n### AliExpress Open Platform Setup\n\nBegin with developer account\
    \ registration on the AliExpress Open Platform. Navigate to their developer portal\
    \ and create a new application. Select \"Server-side API integration\" as your\
    \ application type. Provide your Odoo instance details in the callback URL field.\
    \ The platform requires business verification before granting production API access.\n\
    \nNote your App Key and App Secret immediately after creation. These credentials\
    \ authenticate all API calls between your systems. Store them securely in Odoo's\
    \ parameter table rather than hardcoding in your module. The Open Platform imposes\
    \ strict rate limits based on your application tier. Understand these limits before\
    \ designing your synchronization intervals.\n\nConfigure API permissions for your\
    \ application. Enable orders:read for order synchronization. Activate products:read\
    \ for product information retrieval. Select logistics:read for shipping status\
    \ updates. Each permission scope requires separate approval from AliExpress. The\
    \ review process typically takes 2-3 business days.\n\n### Odoo Module Development\n\
    \nCreate a new Odoo module using their standard scaffold command. Define your\
    \ module dependencies in the __manifest__.py file. Your module must declare dependencies\
    \ on the sale, stock, and product modules. Create models for AliExpress store\
    \ configuration and synchronization logs. These models track integration status\
    \ and facilitate troubleshooting.\n\nImplement the core AliExpress client class\
    \ within your module. This class handles API authentication, request signing,\
    \ and error handling. Use Python's requests library for HTTP communication. Implement\
    \ automatic token refresh logic to maintain API access. The client should manage\
    \ rate limit headers and respect retry-after directives.\n\n```python\nclass AliExpressClient:\n\
    \    def __init__(self, app_key, app_secret, store_id):\n        self.base_url\
    \ = \"https://api.aliexpress.com/rest\"\n        self.app_key = app_key\n    \
    \    self.app_secret = app_secret\n        self.store_id = store_id\n        self.access_token\
    \ = None\n        self.token_expiry = None\n        \n    def _refresh_token(self):\n\
    \        # Implementation for token refresh\n        params = {\n            'app_key':\
    \ self.app_key,\n            'app_secret': self.app_secret,\n            'grant_type':\
    \ 'refresh_token'\n        }\n        response = requests.post(f\"{self.base_url}/auth/token/refresh\"\
    , params=params)\n        data = response.json()\n        self.access_token =\
    \ data['access_token']\n        self.token_expiry = datetime.now() + timedelta(seconds=data['expires_in'])\n\
    ```\n\n### Authentication Implementation\n\nConfigure OAuth 2.0 authentication\
    \ between your systems. The AliExpress Open Platform uses authorization code flow.\
    \ Implement the callback endpoint in your Odoo module to handle the authorization\
    \ response. Store the refresh token securely in your AliExpress store configuration\
    \ model. The system uses this token to obtain short-lived access tokens for API\
    \ calls.\n\nAdd the authentication setup interface to Odoo's settings menu. Create\
    \ a form view for store configuration with fields for App Key, App Secret, and\
    \ Store ID. Implement a connect button that redirects users to AliExpress authorization.\
    \ Handle the callback parameters to complete the OAuth flow. Store the authorization\
    \ code and exchange it for access and refresh tokens.\n\n```xml\n<record id=\"\
    view_aliexpress_config_form\" model=\"ir.ui.view\">\n    <field name=\"name\"\
    >aliexpress.config.form</field>\n    <field name=\"model\">aliexpress.store.config</field>\n\
    \    <field name=\"arch\" type=\"xml\">\n        <form>\n            <group>\n\
    \                <field name=\"name\"/>\n                <field name=\"app_key\"\
    />\n                <field name=\"app_secret\"/>\n                <field name=\"\
    store_id\"/>\n                <field name=\"active\"/>\n            </group>\n\
    \            <footer>\n                <button name=\"action_connect\" type=\"\
    object\" string=\"Connect to AliExpress\"/>\n            </footer>\n        </form>\n\
    \    </field>\n</record>\n```\n\n### Synchronization Configuration\n\nDefine synchronization\
    \ jobs using Odoo's scheduled action framework. Create separate jobs for order\
    \ import, inventory export, and product sync. Configure order import to run every\
    \ 15 minutes during business hours. Set inventory sync to trigger on stock level\
    \ changes. Implement product synchronization as a manual process for initial setup.\n\
    \nConfigure field mapping between AliExpress and Odoo data models. Map AliExpress\
    \ order status to Odoo's sales order states. Define transformation rules for customer\
    \ addresses and product attributes. Set up tax calculation rules based on destination\
    \ countries. Configure shipping method mapping between AliExpress carriers and\
    \ your Odoo delivery methods.\n\n### Webhook Registration\n\nImplement webhook\
    \ endpoint handlers in your Odoo module. Create controllers to receive AliExpress\
    \ notifications for order events. These endpoints must verify request signatures\
    \ to ensure authenticity. Process webhook payloads asynchronously to maintain\
    \ quick response times. Register your webhook URLs with AliExpress using their\
    \ management API.\n\nTest webhook delivery during your development phase. Use\
    \ ngrok or similar tunneling services to expose your local Odoo instance. Verify\
    \ that your endpoints handle duplicate events idempotently. Implement security\
    \ checks to reject malformed or suspicious requests. Log all webhook activities\
    \ for audit purposes and troubleshooting.\n\n## Data Mapping and Transformation\
    \ (600 words)\n\n### Order Data Structure\n\nAliExpress orders arrive with a nested\
    \ JSON structure containing buyer information, product details, and logistics\
    \ data. Your integration must flatten this structure into Odoo's relational model.\
    \ Map the AliExpress order number to Odoo's origin field. Extract the buyer's\
    \ name and shipping address into Odoo's partner records. Preserve the original\
    \ AliExpress order ID in a custom field for reference.\n\nTransform AliExpress\
    \ combination orders into Odoo sale order lines. Each combination item becomes\
    \ a separate order line with specific product attributes. Map AliExpress SKU codes\
    \ to Odoo product defaults. Handle currency conversion between USD and your Odoo\
    \ company currency. Calculate taxes based on the shipping destination and your\
    \ business rules.\n\n### Product Information Mapping\n\nAliExpress products present\
    \ challenges with their combination-based variation system. Map AliExpress main\
    \ products to Odoo product templates. Transform each combination into a Odoo product\
    \ variant. Extract combination attributes like color, size, and style into Odoo's\
    \ attribute-value system. Preserve the original AliExpress product and combination\
    \ IDs for inventory synchronization.\n\nManage product image import from AliExpress\
    \ multiple image URLs. Download and store images in Odoo's attachment system.\
    \ Set the first image as the main product image. Handle character encoding issues\
    \ in product descriptions and titles. Convert HTML descriptions to plain text\
    \ for Odoo's product notes field. Preserve essential formatting while removing\
    \ incompatible HTML tags.\n\n### Inventory Synchronization Logic\n\nInventory\
    \ synchronization requires careful conflict resolution between systems. Odoo typically\
    \ serves as the inventory master, but you must respect AliExpress stock levels\
    \ during initial setup. Implement a stock reservation mechanism for pending orders.\
    \ Calculate available quantities by considering both committed and on-hand stock.\n\
    \nTransform Odoo's warehouse-specific inventory into AliExpress's global stock\
    \ model. Aggregate stock across multiple warehouses if you fulfill from multiple\
    \ locations. Apply safety stock buffers to prevent overselling. Handle stock update\
    \ failures with automatic retry logic. Log all inventory changes for reconciliation\
    \ purposes.\n\n### Customer Data Handling\n\nAliExpress provides limited customer\
    \ information due to privacy restrictions. Create Odoo partners using the available\
    \ shipping address data. Use the buyer's AliExpress username as the partner name\
    \ if real name isn't available. Map shipping addresses to Odoo's partner address\
    \ model. Detect duplicate customers based on shipping address patterns.\n\nMaintain\
    \ customer reference in sales orders without creating duplicate partner records.\
    \ Implement a customer matching algorithm that considers name, address, and phone\
    \ number. Create new partners only when no reasonable match exists. Preserve customer\
    \ communication preferences from AliExpress if available.\n\n## Error Handling\
    \ and Resilience (500 words)\n\n### Common API Errors\n\nThe AliExpress API returns\
    \ specific error codes your integration must handle. \"isv.invalid-parameter\"\
    \ errors indicate missing or malformed request parameters. \"isv.invalid-permission\"\
    \ errors occur when your app lacks necessary scopes. \"isv.api-quota-limit\" errors\
    \ signal rate limit violations. \"isv.need-retry\" errors suggest temporary system\
    \ issues.\n\nImplement automatic retry logic for transient errors. Use exponential\
    \ backoff for rate limit responses. Queue failed requests for later processing\
    \ when encountering system errors. Log all API errors with full context for debugging.\
    \ Alert administrators when error rates exceed defined thresholds.\n\n### Data\
    \ Validation Failures\n\nData validation errors occur when AliExpress data doesn't\
    \ match Odoo's expectations. Missing required fields like product SKUs or customer\
    \ addresses cause import failures. Invalid data formats such as malformed dates\
    \ or currency values trigger validation errors. Reference integrity issues happen\
    \ when related records don't exist in Odoo.\n\nImplement comprehensive data cleansing\
    \ before import. Apply default values for missing required fields. Transform data\
    \ formats to match Odoo's requirements. Create missing related records automatically\
    \ when possible. Flag records that require manual intervention for complex issues.\n\
    \n### Connection and Timeout Handling\n\nNetwork issues between your Odoo instance\
    \ and AliExpress API can cause synchronization failures. Implement robust connection\
    \ timeout settings. Use short timeouts for initial connection attempts. Set longer\
    \ timeouts for data transfer phases. Implement circuit breaker patterns to prevent\
    \ cascade failures during API outages.\n\nHandle DNS resolution failures with\
    \ fallback name servers. Manage SSL certificate verification issues with proper\
    \ error messages. Implement connection pooling to reduce overhead for frequent\
    \ API calls. Monitor connection success rates and alert on degradation.\n\n###\
    \ Recovery Procedures\n\nDevelop specific recovery procedures for different failure\
    \ scenarios. For partial order sync failures, implement gap detection and backfill\
    \ mechanisms. For inventory sync issues, create reconciliation reports that highlight\
    \ discrepancies. For product mapping problems, provide remapping tools to fix\
    \ broken relationships.\n\nMaintain synchronization checkpoints to resume from\
    \ known good states. Implement data repair utilities for common corruption scenarios.\
    \ Create manual override capabilities for emergency situations. Document recovery\
    \ procedures with step-by-step instructions for operations team.\n\n## Testing\
    \ and Validation (500 words)\n\n### Integration Test Scenarios\n\nCreate comprehensive\
    \ test scenarios that cover all integration points. Test order import with various\
    \ AliExpress order types including combination products and single items. Validate\
    \ inventory synchronization with stock increases, decreases, and out-of-stock\
    \ scenarios. Verify product import with different attribute combinations and image\
    \ sets.\n\nTest error conditions deliberately. Simulate API rate limits and verify\
    \ backoff behavior. Trigger network timeouts to confirm graceful degradation.\
    \ Introduce malformed data to validate error handling. Test concurrent operations\
    \ to identify race conditions and locking issues.\n\n### Data Validation Procedures\n\
    \nImplement multi-stage data validation throughout the synchronization process.\
    \ Validate incoming AliExpress data against their API schema. Apply business rule\
    \ validation before creating Odoo records. Verify record creation success by comparing\
    \ counts and checking for errors. Validate data completeness by spot-checking\
    \ field values.\n\nDevelop validation reports that highlight discrepancies between\
    \ systems. Compare order totals between AliExpress and Odoo for accuracy. Verify\
    \ inventory levels match after synchronization cycles. Check product attribute\
    \ preservation across the integration pipeline.\n\n### Performance Testing\n\n\
    Establish performance benchmarks for critical integration operations. Measure\
    \ order import throughput in orders per minute. Time inventory synchronization\
    \ for typical product catalogs. Assess product import performance with various\
    \ image quantities. Monitor system resource usage during peak synchronization\
    \ periods.\n\nTest scalability with increasing data volumes. Verify performance\
    \ remains consistent as order history grows. Ensure product catalog size doesn't\
    \ degrade synchronization speed. Confirm memory usage remains stable during extended\
    \ operation.\n\n### User Acceptance Testing\n\nDevelop UAT scenarios that mirror\
    \ real business operations. Create test cases for common user workflows like order\
    \ processing and inventory management. Validate reporting accuracy after synchronization.\
    \ Test edge cases like returns, cancellations, and refunds. Verify customer communication\
    \ maintains data integrity.\n\nInvolve actual users from different departments\
    \ in testing. Gather feedback from sales, warehouse, and customer service teams.\
    \ Incorporate their real-world scenarios into your test plans. Validate that the\
    \ integration solves their specific pain points.\n\n## Security Considerations\
    \ (400 words)\n\n### Authentication Security\n\nImplement secure credential management\
    \ for AliExpress API access. Store App Key and App Secret in Odoo's parameter\
    \ table with appropriate access controls. Use Odoo's built-in encryption for sensitive\
    \ authentication data. Rotate API credentials periodically according to your security\
    \ policy.\n\nSecure OAuth token storage and refresh mechanisms. Implement proper\
    \ token expiration handling. Use secure HTTP headers for all API communications.\
    \ Validate SSL certificates for all external connections. Implement certificate\
    \ pinning if the AliExpress API supports it.\n\n### Data Protection\n\nProtect\
    \ customer data during transmission and storage. Use TLS 1.2 or higher for all\
    \ API communications. Encrypt sensitive data at rest in Odoo's database. Implement\
    \ access controls that limit data exposure to authorized users. Log data access\
    \ for security monitoring.\n\nApply data minimization principles to imported information.\
    \ Only store necessary AliExpress data in Odoo. Implement data retention policies\
    \ for synchronization logs. Secure backup data with the same protection as live\
    \ information.\n\n### API Security\n\nImplement robust input validation for all\
    \ incoming webhook requests. Verify webhook signatures to prevent spoofing. Validate\
    \ all API responses before processing. Implement rate limiting on your webhook\
    \ endpoints to prevent abuse. Use non-guessable webhook URLs with sufficient entropy.\n\
    \nMonitor API usage for suspicious patterns. Alert on unexpected increases in\
    \ API call volumes. Implement anomaly detection for order import patterns. Log\
    \ security events for later analysis and incident response.\n\n### Compliance\
    \ Requirements\n\nEnsure your integration complies with relevant data protection\
    \ regulations. Map data flows to identify compliance obligations. Implement necessary\
    \ consent mechanisms for customer data. Provide data export and deletion capabilities\
    \ for compliance requests.\n\nDocument your security controls for audit purposes.\
    \ Maintain records of security testing and vulnerability assessments. Establish\
    \ incident response procedures for data breaches. Regularly review and update\
    \ security measures.\n\n## Performance Optimization (400 words)\n\n### API Call\
    \ Optimization\n\nReduce AliExpress API calls through intelligent batching and\
    \ caching. Batch order queries to fetch multiple orders in single requests. Cache\
    \ product information to avoid repeated lookups. Implement request coalescing\
    \ to eliminate duplicate API calls. Use field selectors to retrieve only necessary\
    \ data.\n\nOptimize synchronization timing based on business patterns. Schedule\
    \ order imports during off-peak hours on AliExpress. Stagger inventory updates\
    \ to avoid rate limit violations. Implement incremental synchronization to process\
    \ only changed records. Use webhooks to eliminate unnecessary polling.\n\n###\
    \ Database Performance\n\nOptimize Odoo database performance for integration workloads.\
    \ Add indexes on AliExpress reference fields to speed up lookups. Implement database\
    \ partitioning for large synchronization log tables. Use partial indexes for frequently\
    \ queried status fields. Monitor query performance and optimize slow operations.\n\
    \nTune Odoo's ORM configuration for bulk operations. Use prefetch patterns to\
    \ reduce database round trips. Implement bulk create and update operations for\
    \ better performance. Avoid N+1 query problems in synchronization code. Use read-only\
    \ queries when possible to reduce locking.\n\n### Memory Management\n\nImplement\
    \ efficient memory usage patterns in synchronization jobs. Process large datasets\
    \ in manageable chunks. Use generator expressions instead of lists for large result\
    \ sets. Implement streaming processing for large product catalogs. Clear object\
    \ caches between processing batches to prevent memory bloat.\n\nMonitor memory\
    \ usage during synchronization operations. Implement memory limits for background\
    \ jobs. Use efficient data structures for in-memory processing. Profile memory\
    \ usage to identify and fix leaks.\n\n### Monitoring and Metrics\n\nImplement\
    \ comprehensive monitoring for integration performance. Track synchronization\
    \ duration, success rates, and data volumes. Monitor API response times and error\
    \ rates. Alert on performance degradation or increasing error rates. Establish\
    \ performance baselines and track deviations.\n\nCreate dashboards that visualize\
    \ integration health and performance. Monitor system resource usage during synchronization.\
