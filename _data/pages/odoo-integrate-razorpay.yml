  main_content: '## Integration Architecture and Data Flow


    ### Core Integration Components

    The Razorpay-Odoo integration operates on a distributed event-driven architecture.
    Odoo 18''s payment acquirer module serves as the foundation, providing the core
    framework for payment processing. This module handles transaction initiation,
    status management, and financial reconciliation. The Razorpay API acts as the
    payment gateway, processing card transactions, UPI payments, and net banking requests.
    A dedicated webhook endpoint in Odoo receives asynchronous payment confirmations
    from Razorpay''s servers.


    Your integration must manage bidirectional data flow between these systems. The
    customer initiates a payment through the Odoo website or sales portal. Odoo creates
    a transaction record and redirects the customer to Razorpay''s payment page. Razorpay
    processes the payment and sends a success or failure response. Simultaneously,
    Razorpay dispatches a webhook event to your Odoo instance with detailed payment
    verification data. This dual-confirmation system ensures transaction integrity.


    ### Payment Flow Sequence

    The transaction sequence begins when a customer selects Razorpay as their payment
    method. Odoo generates a unique transaction ID and creates a payment request to
    Razorpay''s Orders API. This API call includes the amount, currency, customer
    details, and callback URLs. Razorpay returns a payment ID that Odoo stores for
    future reference. The customer completes the payment on Razorpay''s secure hosted
    page.


    Following payment completion, Razorpay redirects the customer back to Odoo''s
    return URL. Odoo immediately queries Razorpay''s Payments API to verify the transaction
    status. This synchronous check provides instant user feedback. Meanwhile, Razorpay
    sends a separate webhook request to Odoo''s designated endpoint with comprehensive
    payment details. This asynchronous verification serves as the system of record
    for payment confirmation.


    ### Data Synchronization Patterns

    The integration employs multiple synchronization strategies for different data
    types. Payment transactions use real-time webhook notifications for immediate
    processing. Settlement data follows a daily batch synchronization pattern, where
    Odoo fetches the previous day''s payout information. Refund operations require
    bidirectional synchronization, with Odoo initiating refunds and Razorpay confirming
    their processing.


    Your architecture must handle network partitions and service outages. Implement
    idempotent webhook handlers that process duplicate events without creating duplicate
    records. Store Razorpay payment IDs as unique constraints in your Odoo transaction
    tables. Design your settlement reconciliation to handle partial data and correction
    entries. These patterns ensure financial data consistency across both platforms.


    ## Step-by-Step Configuration


    ### Razorpay Account Configuration

    Begin with your Razorpay merchant dashboard configuration. Log into your Razorpay
    account and navigate to the Settings section. Access the API Keys page and generate
    new API keys for your Odoo integration. The test mode keys allow safe development,
    while live keys process real transactions. Store the key_id and key_secret in
    a secure location for Odoo configuration.


    Configure your Razorpay webhooks to point to your Odoo instance. In the Razorpay
    dashboard, navigate to Webhooks under the Settings menu. Create a new webhook
    endpoint with your Odoo server''s base URL followed by ''/payment/razorpay/webhook''.
    Select these essential events: payment.authorized, payment.captured, payment.failed,
    and refund.created. Razorpay will send POST requests to this endpoint for all
    selected payment events.


    Enable required payment methods in your Razorpay account based on your business
    needs. Activate credit cards, debit cards, UPI, net banking, and popular wallets.
    Configure payment capture settings to either automatic or manual mode based on
    your business workflow. Automatic capture immediately processes payments, while
    manual capture allows order verification before fund transfer.


    ### Odoo Payment Acquirer Setup

    Install the payment_razorpay module in your Odoo 18 instance. Navigate to the
    Apps menu and search for "Razorpay" or install it via command line. The module
    extends Odoo''s payment provider framework with Razorpay-specific functionality.
    Enable developer mode in Odoo to access advanced configuration options for payment
    providers.


    Create a new Razorpay payment acquirer in Odoo. Go to Invoicing → Configuration
    → Payment Acquirers and create a new record. Select Razorpay as the provider type.
    Enter your Razorpay API credentials in the corresponding fields. Configure the
    return URLs for successful and failed payments. These URLs direct customers back
    to your Odoo website after payment completion.


    Set the webhook endpoint in your Odoo configuration. The system generates a unique
    webhook URL for your Razorpay configuration. Copy this URL to your Razorpay webhook
    settings. Odoo signs all outgoing webhook requests with a secret key for verification.
    Store this signature secret in your Razorpay webhook configuration for request
    validation.


    ### Environment-Specific Configuration

    Configure separate settings for your development, staging, and production environments.
    Use Razorpay test mode keys for development and staging instances. Create environment-specific
    configuration files that store API credentials and webhook secrets. Implement
    different base URLs for webhook endpoints across environments to prevent cross-environment
    event processing.


    Set appropriate payment method restrictions based on your target market. Disable
    payment methods not relevant to your customer base to simplify the checkout experience.
    Configure country-specific payment options through the Razorpay dashboard and
    mirror these settings in Odoo. Implement currency mapping between your Odoo company
    settings and Razorpay''s supported currencies.


    Establish transaction fee handling in your Odoo configuration. Determine whether
    your business absorbs Razorpay transaction fees or passes them to customers. Configure
    fee calculation in the payment acquirer settings. Implement proper accounting
    journal entries to track payment processing costs separately from product revenue.


    ### Code Implementation Details

    Extend the PaymentProvider class in Odoo to implement Razorpay-specific methods.
    Override the _get_default_payment_method_codes method to return Razorpay-compatible
    payment types. Implement the _razorpay_make_request method to handle API communication
    with proper error handling and logging.


    Create the payment form rendering method that generates the Razorpay checkout
    interface. This method injects the necessary JavaScript SDK and initializes the
    payment flow. Implement the form submission handler that processes the Razorpay
    response and updates the transaction status in Odoo.


    Develop the webhook controller that handles Razorpay''s POST requests. This controller
    must verify the webhook signature before processing any data. Implement idempotent
    processing to handle duplicate webhook deliveries. Create proper error logging
    and notification for failed webhook processing attempts.


    ### Common Configuration Issues

    Address frequent configuration problems that disrupt the integration. Webhook
    verification failures often stem from incorrect signature secrets or mismatched
    URLs. Test your webhook endpoint using Razorpay''s webhook simulator before going
    live. Payment redirect errors commonly result from improper return URL configuration
    in both systems.


    API authentication errors typically indicate incorrect key_id or key_secret values.
    Verify your API keys correspond to the correct environment mode. Currency mismatch
    errors occur when Odoo tries to process payments in currencies not enabled in
    your Razorpay account. Ensure currency support alignment between both platforms.


    Transaction amount discrepancies often stem from rounding differences or currency
    conversion. Implement precise decimal handling in your amount calculations. Test
    with various amount values to identify rounding issues before production deployment.


    ## Data Mapping and Transformation


    ### Payment Transaction Mapping

    Establish precise field mapping between Razorpay payment objects and Odoo account.move
    records. Map the Razorpay payment_id to Odoo''s transaction reference field for
    cross-system identification. Transform Razorpay''s amount field from paise (Indian
    subunit) to your Odoo currency units. Handle currency conversion for international
    payments based on real-time exchange rates.


    Map Razorpay''s payment status to Odoo''s transaction states. Transform ''captured''
    to ''done'', ''authorized'' to ''authorized'', and ''failed'' to ''error''. Handle
    edge cases like ''refunded'' and ''partially_refunded'' by creating corresponding
    refund records in Odoo. Implement status synchronization to resolve discrepancies
    between the systems.


    Process customer information from Razorpay''s contact object to Odoo''s res.partner
    model. Extract email and phone fields for customer identification and communication.
    Create new partner records when transactions originate from unknown customers.
    Update existing customer records with payment method information for future transactions.


    ### Order and Invoice Synchronization

    Link Razorpay payments to Odoo sales orders and invoices through reference mapping.
    Store Odoo invoice numbers in Razorpay''s notes field during payment creation.
    Extract these references during webhook processing to associate payments with
    correct invoices. Implement fallback matching using amount and customer email
    when references become missing.


    Handle partial payments and installment scenarios through careful amount tracking.
    Create multiple payment transactions for a single invoice when customers use split
    payment methods. Implement proper allocation logic to ensure invoice payment status
    reflects the actual collected amount. Track pending amounts for future payment
    collection.


    Manage refund operations with bidirectional synchronization. When Odoo creates
    a refund, initiate a corresponding refund in Razorpay through their Refunds API.
    Capture the Razorpay refund ID and link it to the Odoo account.move reversal record.
    Handle partial refunds by creating proportional transaction records in both systems.


    ### Settlement and Reconciliation Data

    Transform Razorpay settlement data into Odoo bank statement lines. Map settlement
    IDs to statement line references for audit trail purposes. Process settlement
    amounts after deducting Razorpay fees into your bank account records. Handle multi-currency
    settlements by applying appropriate exchange rates on settlement dates.


    Reconcile settled payments with original transactions using Razorpay payment IDs
    as the correlation key. Implement automatic matching based on transaction references
    and amounts. Create reconciliation rules for handling bank charges and processing
    fees separately from principal amounts. Flag unmatched transactions for manual
    review and resolution.


    Process correction entries and adjustments from Razorpay settlements. Handle scenarios
    where Razorpay corrects previous settlement amounts due to chargebacks or disputes.
    Create adjustment journal entries in Odoo that clearly identify the reason for
    the correction. Maintain complete audit trails of all settlement modifications.


    ### Webhook Data Processing

    Transform Razorpay webhook payloads into Odoo payment transactions. Extract the
    essential payment data from the nested event structure. Verify payload integrity
    using the Razorpay-Signature header before processing. Implement idempotent processing
    by checking for existing transactions with the same webhook event ID.


    Handle webhook retries and duplicate deliveries through proper idempotency keys.
    Store processed webhook event IDs to prevent duplicate transaction creation. Implement
    exponential backoff for webhook processing failures to avoid overwhelming your
    system with retry attempts. Create dead-letter queue handling for persistently
    failing webhooks.


    Process asynchronous payment confirmations that arrive after customer redirects.
    Handle race conditions between synchronous payment status checks and webhook deliveries.
    Implement proper transaction locking to prevent duplicate order fulfillment. Update
    order status based on the most reliable payment confirmation source.


    ## Error Handling and Resilience


    ### API Communication Errors

    Handle Razorpay API rate limiting with exponential backoff retry logic. Implement
    circuit breaker patterns to prevent cascading failures during Razorpay service
    outages. Store failed API requests in a queue for later processing when the service
    recovers. Log API errors with sufficient context for debugging without exposing
    sensitive data.


    Manage network timeouts and connection failures with appropriate retry strategies.
    Set conservative timeout values for API calls to prevent blocking your Odoo workers.
    Implement asynchronous processing for non-critical operations like receipt generation
    and notification emails. Use background jobs for operations that don''t require
    immediate user feedback.


    Process API response validation failures by logging the unexpected data structure.
    Implement schema validation for all Razorpay API responses before processing.
    Reject malformed responses and trigger alerts for investigation. Maintain compatibility
    with multiple Razorpay API versions through careful response handling.


    ### Payment Processing Failures

    Handle payment authorization failures by analyzing the error code from Razorpay.
    Map common error codes like ''BAD_REQUEST'' and ''SERVER_ERROR'' to user-friendly
    messages. Implement smart retry for temporary failures like network issues. Block
    retry for permanent failures like invalid card numbers.


    Process webhook verification failures by rejecting unverified requests immediately.
    Log verification failures with client IP information for security monitoring.
    Implement rate limiting on webhook endpoints to prevent denial-of-service attacks.
    Create alerts for repeated webhook verification failures from the same source.


    Manage payment capture failures for authorized payments. Implement retry mechanisms
    for capture operations that fail due to temporary issues. Handle insufficient
    fund scenarios by notifying customers and providing alternative payment methods.
    Create expiration handlers for authorized payments that never complete capture.


    ### Data Synchronization Issues

    Resolve transaction state conflicts between Odoo and Razorpay. Implement reconciliation
    procedures to identify and resolve status mismatches. Create manual intervention
    workflows for transactions that require human review. Develop automated correction
    scripts for common synchronization problems.


    Handle missing webhook events through periodic synchronization jobs. Query Razorpay
    for payments that lack confirmation in Odoo. Process these payments with appropriate
    status based on their current state in Razorpay. Implement gap detection to identify
    missing payment events in your webhook processing pipeline.


    Manage refund synchronization failures that create financial discrepancies. Implement
    bidirectional refund status checks to ensure consistency. Create manual resolution
    procedures for refunds that fail to synchronize properly. Develop compensation
    mechanisms for customers affected by refund processing failures.


    ### System Recovery Procedures

    Implement disaster recovery for payment data loss scenarios. Create regular backups
    of payment transaction data and webhook processing logs. Develop restoration procedures
    that rebuild payment state from Razorpay API data. Test recovery procedures regularly
    to ensure business continuity.


    Handle database rollback scenarios without losing payment information. Implement
    compensating transactions for failed business processes. Create audit trails that
    track all payment state changes for reconstruction purposes. Develop verification
    tools that validate data consistency between Odoo and Razorpay.


    Manage key rotation and credential updates without service interruption. Implement
    seamless transition procedures for API key updates. Develop fallback mechanisms
    for handling expired credentials during maintenance windows. Create alerts for
    impending credential expiration to prevent service disruption.


    ## Testing and Validation


    ### Development Environment Testing

    Establish a comprehensive test environment with Razorpay test mode. Create test
    cases that cover all payment scenarios your business requires. Use Razorpay''s
    test card numbers to simulate successful, failed, and pending payments. Test international
    payment processing with various currencies and payment methods.


    Verify webhook processing with Razorpay''s webhook simulator tool. Test all webhook
    event types your integration handles. Validate that your webhook endpoint processes
    duplicate events idempotently. Verify signature verification rejects tampered
    requests while accepting legitimate ones.


    Test the complete payment flow from initiation to settlement reconciliation. Simulate
    customer drop-off at various stages of the payment process. Verify that abandoned
    payments handle properly without creating order fulfillment issues. Test simultaneous
    payments from multiple customers to identify concurrency problems.


    ### Integration Testing Scenarios

    Create test cases for network failure scenarios during critical operations. Simulate
    Razorpay API downtime during payment initiation and status checks. Verify your
    system handles timeouts gracefully without losing transaction data. Test recovery
    procedures when services become available after outages.


    Validate error handling for invalid payment data and malformed API responses.
    Test with extreme amount values, special characters in customer data, and missing
    required fields. Verify your system logs appropriate errors without exposing sensitive
    information to users. Test boundary conditions like minimum and maximum payment
    amounts.


    Perform load testing to verify system performance under high transaction volumes.
    Simulate peak sales periods with simultaneous payment processing requests. Measure
    response times for payment initiation, status checks, and webhook processing.
    Identify performance bottlenecks and optimize before production deployment.

    ## Security Considerations


    ### API Security Implementation

    Protect Razorpay API keys with proper access controls in Odoo. Store key_secret
    values in Odoo''s configuration parameters with appropriate security flags. Restrict
    access to payment acquirer configuration to authorized administrators only. Implement
    audit logging for all changes to payment processing settings.


    Secure API communication with transport layer encryption. Verify SSL certificate
    validation for all requests to Razorpay''s API endpoints. Implement certificate
    pinning to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. Use latest TLS versions for all
    external communication.


    Manage webhook security with signature verification. Validate the Razorpay-Signature
    header for all incoming webhook requests. Reject requests with invalid signatures
    or missing verification headers. Implement timestamp validation to prevent replay
    attacks using old webhook payloads.


    ### Data Protection Measures

    Anonymize sensitive payment data in logs and error messages. Implement data masking
    for card numbers, customer identifiers, and API keys in application logs. Create
    separate audit logs for payment operations that exclude sensitive information.
    Develop data retention policies that automatically purge unnecessary payment data.


    Secure customer payment information during transmission and storage. Never store
    complete card details or bank account information in Odoo databases. Tokenize
    sensitive payment instruments using Razorpay''s tokenization service. Implement
    database encryption for any payment-related data you must retain.


    Protect against common web application vulnerabilities in payment processing.
    Implement CSRF protection for all payment initiation endpoints. Validate and sanitize
    all input parameters in payment controllers. Use parameterized queries to prevent
    SQL injection in database operations.


    ### Compliance and Access Control

    Maintain PCI DSS compliance through proper handling of cardholder data. Ensure
    your integration never touches raw card information by using Razorpay''s hosted
    payment pages. Conduct regular security assessments of your payment processing
    infrastructure. Maintain audit trails for all payment-related operations.


    Implement role-based access control for payment operations. Restrict payment processing
    capabilities to authorized personnel only. Create separate roles for payment initiation,
    refund processing, and reconciliation activities. Implement segregation of duties
    to prevent fraud through excessive privileges.


    Establish security monitoring for suspicious payment activities. Create alerts
    for unusual transaction patterns or multiple failed payment attempts. Monitor
    for webhook endpoint abuse through rate limiting and intrusion detection. Develop
    incident response procedures for security breaches involving payment data.


    ## Performance Optimization


    ### Payment Processing Optimization

    Implement strategic caching for Razorpay API responses to reduce external calls.
    Cache payment method configuration and currency exchange rates with appropriate
    expiration times. Avoid caching dynamic data like payment status and account balances.
    Use cache warming techniques for frequently accessed payment information.


    Optimize database queries for payment transaction processing. Create appropriate
    indexes on transaction reference fields and payment dates. Implement query optimization
    for reconciliation procedures that process large transaction volumes. Use database
    connection pooling to handle concurrent payment operations.


    Reduce payment page load times through efficient asset delivery. Minify JavaScript
    and CSS resources for the payment checkout interface. Implement lazy loading for
    non-critical payment form components. Use content delivery networks for static
    assets related to payment processing.


    ### Webhook Processing Efficiency

    Scale webhook processing through background job distribution. Implement queue-based
    processing for webhook events to handle traffic spikes. Use multiple worker processes
    to parallelize webhook handling during peak loads. Monitor queue depths and scale
    worker capacity based on incoming webhook volume.


    Optimize webhook validation and processing for maximum throughput. Implement efficient
    signature verification algorithms that minimize CPU overhead. Use database connection
    reuse within webhook handlers to reduce connection establishment overhead. Batch
    process webhook events where possible to reduce database write operations.


    Implement webhook rate limiting without sacrificing reliability. Use sliding window
    algorithms to smooth incoming webhook traffic. Prioritize critical webhook events
    like payment captures over less urgent notifications. Implement graceful degradation
    when webhook processing reaches capacity limits.


    ### System Monitoring and Tuning

    Establish comprehensive performance monitoring for all integration components.
    Track API response times, webhook processing latency, and database query performance.
    Set performance baselines and create alerts for deviations from normal operation.
    Monitor system resource utilization during peak payment processing periods.


    Implement automatic scaling for payment processing components. Scale web application
    servers based on incoming payment request volume. Adjust background worker capacity
    based on queue depths and processing backlogs. Use database read replicas to handle
    reporting queries without impacting transaction processing.


    Conduct regular performance testing and optimization reviews. Analyze payment
    processing performance trends to identify degradation over time. Perform load
    testing before major sales events to ensure capacity adequacy. Optimize database
    performance through query analysis and index tuning.'
