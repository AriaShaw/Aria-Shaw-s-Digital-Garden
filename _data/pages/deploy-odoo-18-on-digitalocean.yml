  main_content: '## Infrastructure Planning and Architecture


    ### DigitalOcean Resource Allocation


    Your Odoo 18 deployment requires careful resource planning from the start. Choose
    a DigitalOcean droplet with sufficient CPU and memory for your expected user load.
    For development environments, the Basic droplet with 2GB RAM and 1 vCPU handles
    light testing. Production deployments demand Premium or CPU-Optimized droplets
    starting at 4GB RAM for teams under 10 users. Scale to 8GB RAM or higher for larger
    teams or heavy module usage.


    The droplet location impacts performance for your primary user base. Select a
    region that minimizes latency for your team and customers. DigitalOcean offers
    global data centers across North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific. Consider data
    sovereignty requirements when choosing your deployment region. European companies
    may prefer Frankfurt or London to comply with GDPR data residency needs.


    Plan your storage strategy around performance and backup requirements. DigitalOcean''s
    block storage provides scalable capacity separate from your droplet''s local SSD.
    Attach a 50GB volume for Odoo filestore and database backups. This separation
    lets you resize storage without rebuilding the entire server. Implement regular
    snapshot schedules for disaster recovery.


    ### Network Security Design


    Design your network security with a zero-trust approach from the beginning. DigitalOcean
    Cloud Firewalls provide your first defense layer. Configure rules that permit
    only essential traffic—SSH access from your IP range, HTTP/HTTPS from anywhere,
    and custom ports for database connections if needed. Block all other inbound traffic
    by default.


    Segment your services across multiple droplets for production environments. Run
    PostgreSQL on a separate droplet from your Odoo application server. This isolation
    limits attack surface and contains potential breaches. Use private networking
    for database connections between droplets. DigitalOcean''s private network offers
    free data transfer between resources in the same data center.


    Implement a bastion host architecture for administrative access. Never expose
    your database or application servers directly to the public internet. Configure
    a dedicated jump host with strict IP whitelisting for SSH access. This approach
    centralizes your security monitoring and reduces the attack vectors against your
    core infrastructure.


    ### High Availability Considerations


    Plan for redundancy early, even if you deploy a single server initially. DigitalOcean
    Load Balancers distribute traffic across multiple application servers. Configure
    health checks that monitor Odoo''s web interface and API endpoints. The load balancer
    automatically routes traffic away from unhealthy instances.


    Design your database architecture for failover protection. DigitalOcean Managed
    Databases offer automated backups and high availability configurations. The platform
    handles replication and failover without manual intervention. This service costs
    more than self-managed PostgreSQL but reduces operational overhead significantly.


    Implement a comprehensive backup strategy across all infrastructure layers. DigitalOcean
    snapshots capture your entire droplet state at regular intervals. Combine this
    with Odoo''s built-in database backup functionality for point-in-time recovery.
    Test your restoration process quarterly to verify backup integrity.


    ## Initial Server Configuration


    ### Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Setup


    Begin with a clean Ubuntu 22.04 LTS droplet on DigitalOcean. The LTS version guarantees
    long-term support and security updates. Choose the minimal installation image
    to reduce attack surface. DigitalOcean''s one-click Ubuntu setup automates the
    initial provisioning process. Wait for the droplet creation to complete before
    proceeding.


    Update the system packages immediately after deployment. Run `apt update && apt
    upgrade -y` to patch known vulnerabilities. Reboot the server if the kernel receives
    an update. Configure automatic security updates with `unattended-upgrades` to
    maintain ongoing protection. Edit `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades`
    to enable critical security patches.


    Create a dedicated user account for Odoo operations. Avoid using the root account
    for daily tasks. Run `adduser odoo` to create a new system user. Add this user
    to the sudo group with `usermod -aG sudo odoo`. Switch to the odoo user account
    for subsequent configuration steps. This practice limits potential damage from
    accidental mistakes.


    ### SSH Security Hardening


    Secure your SSH access before installing any applications. Change the default
    SSH port from 22 to a custom value between 1024 and 65535. Edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`
    and set `Port 2222` or another non-standard port. This simple change reduces automated
    brute force attacks by 90%.


    Disable password authentication in favor of SSH key pairs. Generate an RSA key
    pair on your local machine with `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096`. Copy the public key
    to the server using `ssh-copy-id -p 2222 odoo@your-server-ip`. Test key-based
    login works before proceeding. Then set `PasswordAuthentication no` in the SSH
    configuration.


    Configure additional SSH security settings for production environments. Set `PermitRootLogin
    no` to prevent direct root access. Use `AllowUsers odoo` to restrict SSH access
    to specific accounts. Implement fail2ban to block IP addresses after repeated
    failed login attempts. These measures create multiple defense layers around your
    primary access method.


    ### System Optimization and Monitoring


    Tune the Linux kernel parameters for web application performance. Increase file
    descriptor limits for Odoo''s concurrent connections. Edit `/etc/security/limits.conf`
    and add `odoo soft nofile 65536` and `odoo hard nofile 65536`. This change allows
    Odoo to handle thousands of simultaneous users without file descriptor exhaustion.


    Configure swap space for memory-constrained environments. Even with sufficient
    RAM, swap provides a safety net during memory spikes. Use `fallocate -l 2G /swapfile`
    to create a 2GB swap file. Set appropriate permissions with `chmod 600 /swapfile`
    and activate with `mkswap /swapfile && swapon /swapfile`. Add the swap file to
    `/etc/fstab` for persistence after reboot.


    Install essential monitoring tools for system visibility. Use `htop` for real-time
    process monitoring and `nethogs` for network traffic analysis. Configure the DigitalOcean
    Metrics agent to track droplet performance through their control panel. Set up
    alert policies for high CPU usage, low memory, or full disk space. Proactive monitoring
    prevents small issues from becoming major outages.


    ## PostgreSQL Database Installation


    ### PostgreSQL 15 Deployment


    Install PostgreSQL 15 from the official repository for optimal performance and
    security. Ubuntu''s default repositories may contain older versions. Add the PostgreSQL
    repository with `sudo sh -c ''echo "deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt
    $(lsb_release -cs)-pgdg main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list''`. Import the
    repository signing key and update your package list.


    Install PostgreSQL 15 and essential contrib packages. Run `sudo apt install postgresql-15
    postgresql-contrib-15` to get the complete database environment. The contrib package
    adds valuable extensions like `pg_trgm` for text search optimization. PostgreSQL
    starts automatically after installation. Verify the service status with `systemctl
    status postgresql`.


    Secure the PostgreSQL installation with configuration changes. Edit `/etc/postgresql/15/main/postgresql.conf`
    and modify the connection settings. Set `listen_addresses = ''localhost''` to
    restrict database access to local connections. Change the default port to a non-standard
    value for additional security. These measures prevent external attacks on your
    database service.


    ### Database Configuration for Odoo


    Create a dedicated PostgreSQL user and database for Odoo. Switch to the postgres
    system account with `sudo -u postgres psql`. Execute `CREATE USER odoo WITH CREATEDB
    PASSWORD ''your-secure-password'';` to create the database role. Then run `CREATE
    DATABASE odoo WITH OWNER odoo ENCODING ''UTF-8'';` to establish the main database.
    Use a strong, unique password for production environments.


    Optimize PostgreSQL performance for Odoo''s workload. Edit `/etc/postgresql/15/main/postgresql.conf`
    and adjust key parameters. Set `shared_buffers` to 25% of your available RAM.
    Configure `effective_cache_size` to 50% of total memory. Adjust `work_mem` based
    on your concurrent user expectations. These settings ensure PostgreSQL handles
    Odoo''s complex queries efficiently.


    Configure PostgreSQL connection pooling with pgBouncer for high-traffic deployments.
    Install pgBouncer with `apt install pgbouncer`. Edit `/etc/pgbouncer/pgbouncer.ini`
    to set up the connection pool. This middleware manages database connections more
    efficiently than Odoo''s built-in pooling. It reduces connection overhead and
    improves response times during peak usage.


    ### Database Security and Backups


    Implement comprehensive database security measures. Configure PostgreSQL to use
    encrypted connections with SSL certificates. Modify `postgresql.conf` to enable
    `ssl = on` and provide certificate paths. Set up client certificate authentication
    for additional security layers. These steps protect sensitive business data in
    transit between Odoo and PostgreSQL.


    Create automated database backup routines. Use PostgreSQL''s built-in `pg_dump`
    for logical backups. Schedule daily backups with cron: `0 2 * * * pg_dump -U odoo
    odoo > /backups/odoo-$(date +\%Y\%m\%d).sql`. Implement backup rotation to manage
    storage usage. Test restoration procedures monthly to verify backup integrity.


    Monitor database performance and health. Install and configure pgBadger for PostgreSQL
    log analysis. Set up alerting for slow queries, connection spikes, or replication
    lag. Use PostgreSQL''s built-in statistics collector to identify performance bottlenecks.
    Proactive monitoring prevents database issues from affecting your Odoo application.


    ## Odoo 18 Application Deployment


    ### Python Environment Setup


    Install Python 3.10 or later for Odoo 18 compatibility. Ubuntu 22.04 includes
    Python 3.10 in its default repositories. Run `sudo apt install python3-pip python3-dev
    python3-venv` to install the complete Python development environment. These packages
    provide the foundation for Odoo''s Python dependencies.


    Create a dedicated Python virtual environment for Odoo. Use `python3 -m venv /opt/odoo/venv`
    to establish an isolated environment. Activate the virtual environment with `source
    /opt/odoo/venv/bin/activate`. This isolation prevents conflicts between Odoo''s
    dependencies and system Python packages. The approach simplifies dependency management
    and future upgrades.


    Install Odoo''s Python dependencies using pip. The requirements vary based on
    your installed modules. Core dependencies include `psycopg2-binary` for PostgreSQL
    connectivity, `pillow` for image processing, and `lxml` for XML handling. Use
    `pip install -r requirements.txt` when available, or install packages individually
    based on Odoo''s documentation.


    ### Odoo Source Code Installation


    Download Odoo 18 source code from the official repository. Use Git for version-controlled
    deployment: `git clone https://github.com/odoo/odoo.git --branch 18.0 --depth
    1 /opt/odoo/odoo-server`. The branch flag ensures you get the stable 18.0 release.
    The depth parameter limits history download for faster deployment.


    Configure Odoo''s deployment directory structure. Create separate directories
    for custom addons, logs, and session data: `mkdir -p /opt/odoo/{addons,sessions,logs}`.
    Set appropriate ownership with `chown -R odoo:odoo /opt/odoo`. This organization
    keeps your Odoo installation clean and manageable.


    Install Odoo''s system dependencies for full functionality. Run `sudo apt install
    build-essential libxslt-dev libldap2-dev libsasl2-dev libssl-dev` to compile Python
    packages with native extensions. These libraries support Odoo''s advanced features
    like LDAP integration and report generation. Missing dependencies cause runtime
    errors and performance issues.


    ### Odoo Configuration File


    Create Odoo''s configuration file at `/etc/odoo.conf` with appropriate permissions.
    Set ownership with `chown odoo:odoo /etc/odoo.conf` and permissions with `chmod
    640`. The configuration file controls all aspects of Odoo''s behavior. Use a minimal
    configuration that specifies essential parameters.


    Configure database connection settings in odoo.conf. Set `db_host = localhost`
    and `db_port = 5432` to connect to your PostgreSQL instance. Specify `db_user
    = odoo` and `db_password = your-secure-password` for authentication. These parameters
    establish the database linkage that Odoo requires at startup.


    Define file paths and operational parameters. Set `addons_path = /opt/odoo/odoo-server/addons,/opt/odoo/addons`
    to include both core and custom modules. Configure `data_dir = /opt/odoo/sessions`
    for session storage. Specify `logfile = /opt/odoo/logs/odoo.log` for centralized
    logging. These paths organize Odoo''s runtime data effectively.


    ### Systemd Service Configuration


    Create a systemd service file for Odoo at `/etc/systemd/system/odoo.service`.
    This approach manages Odoo as a system service with automatic startup and proper
    process supervision. The service file defines execution parameters, user context,
    and restart behavior.


    Configure the service definition with security best practices. Set `User=odoo`
    and `Group=odoo` to run the process with minimal privileges. Specify `ExecStart=/opt/odoo/venv/bin/python3
    /opt/odoo/odoo-server/odoo-bin -c /etc/odoo.conf` to launch Odoo with your configuration.
    These settings ensure Odoo runs in its dedicated environment.


    Enable the Odoo service to start automatically after system reboot. Run `systemctl
    enable odoo` to register the service. Start Odoo with `systemctl start odoo` and
    verify its status with `systemctl status odoo`. Monitor the logs with `journalctl
    -u odoo -f` to identify any startup issues. Proper service management ensures
    Odoo remains available through system maintenance.


    ## Nginx Reverse Proxy Configuration


    ### Nginx Installation and Setup


    Install Nginx from Ubuntu''s official repositories. Run `sudo apt install nginx`
    to get the latest stable version. The package includes both the web server and
    essential management tools. Nginx handles SSL termination, static file serving,
    and load balancing for your Odoo deployment.


    Configure Nginx as a reverse proxy for Odoo. Create a new configuration file at
    `/etc/nginx/sites-available/odoo`. This approach keeps your Odoo configuration
    separate from default Nginx settings. Create a symbolic link to the sites-enabled
    directory to activate the configuration.


    Set up the basic reverse proxy configuration. Define an upstream block that points
    to your Odoo instance: `upstream odoo { server 127.0.0.1:8069; }`. This configuration
    routes incoming HTTP requests to Odoo''s built-in web server. The approach improves
    security by not exposing Odoo directly to the internet.


    ### SSL Certificate Implementation


    Obtain an SSL certificate from Let''s Encrypt using Certbot. Install Certbot with
    `sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx`. Run `sudo certbot --nginx -d
    your-domain.com` to request and install a certificate automatically. Certbot handles
    domain validation and configures Nginx for HTTPS redirection.


    Configure strong SSL security settings in Nginx. Implement modern encryption protocols
    and disable outdated ciphers. Set `ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;` to restrict
    protocol options. Specify strong cipher suites that balance security and compatibility.
    These settings protect sensitive business data during transmission.


    Implement HTTP to HTTPS redirect for all traffic. Create a separate server block
    that listens on port 80. Configure this block to return a 301 redirect to the
    HTTPS version of your site. This practice ensures users always connect through
    encrypted channels, even if they type HTTP URLs.


    ### Performance Optimization


    Configure Nginx for optimal static file handling. Odoo serves many static assets
    like CSS, JavaScript, and images. Set up location blocks that serve these files
    directly from Nginx. This approach reduces load on the Odoo application server
    and improves response times.


    Implement gzip compression for text-based content. Enable `gzip on;` in your Nginx
    configuration. Configure compression levels for different file types: HTML, CSS,
    JavaScript, and JSON. Compression reduces bandwidth usage and speeds up page loads
    for remote users.


    Set appropriate cache control headers for static resources. Configure `expires`
    directives for images, CSS, and JavaScript files. Browser caching reduces repeat
    requests for unchanged assets. This optimization significantly improves perceived
    performance for returning users.


    ## Security Hardening and Firewall


    ### UFW Firewall Configuration


    Configure Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) as your primary defense layer. Enable UFW
    with `sudo ufw enable` after setting up your initial rules. The firewall blocks
    all incoming traffic by default, requiring explicit permission for allowed services.


    Set up firewall rules for essential services. Allow SSH access on your custom
    port with `sudo ufw allow 2222/tcp`. Permit HTTP and HTTPS traffic with `sudo
    ufw allow 80/tcp` and `sudo ufw allow 443/tcp`. These rules maintain accessibility
    while blocking unnecessary ports.


    Implement strict outbound filtering for enhanced security. Configure UFW to restrict
    outgoing connections to essential services only. Allow DNS resolution, package
    updates, and outbound email if needed. This approach prevents data exfiltration
    even if an attacker compromises your system.


    ### Application Security Measures


    Implement fail2ban for automated intrusion prevention. Install with `sudo apt
    install fail2ban` and configure Odoo-specific jails. Create a filter for Odoo
    login attempts and set appropriate ban times. Fail2ban monitors logs and blocks
    IP addresses with suspicious behavior.


    Harden file permissions across your Odoo installation. Set strict ownership and
    access rights for configuration files, especially those containing database passwords.
    Use `chmod 600` for sensitive files and `chmod 644` for public resources. Proper
    permissions limit damage from application-level vulnerabilities.


    Configure Odoo''s built-in security features for production use. Set `list_db
    = False` in odoo.conf to prevent database listing. Implement strong password policies
    for user accounts. Enable two-factor authentication for administrative users.
    These measures protect against common web application attacks.


    ### System Monitoring and Auditing


    Install and configure auditd for system call monitoring. The audit framework tracks
    file access, network activity, and user commands. Set up rules that monitor sensitive
    directories like `/etc/odoo` and `/opt/odoo`. Regular audit review helps detect
    unauthorized access attempts.


    Implement file integrity monitoring with AIDE. Initialize the database with `sudo
    aideinit` and schedule regular checks with cron. AIDE alerts you to unauthorized
    file changes that might indicate a security breach. This monitoring complements
    your backup strategy for complete system protection.


    Set up centralized logging for security analysis. Configure rsyslog to forward
    system logs to a secure remote server. Implement log rotation to manage disk space
    usage. Regular log review helps identify security incidents and operational issues
    before they escalate.


    ## Performance Optimization and Caching


    ### Redis Caching Implementation


    Install Redis server for Odoo session storage and caching. Use `sudo apt install
    redis-server` to get the latest version. Redis handles Odoo''s session data more
    efficiently than file-based storage. The in-memory database reduces load on your
    PostgreSQL instance.


    Configure Redis for optimal memory usage and persistence. Edit `/etc/redis/redis.conf`
    to set appropriate memory limits. Enable RDB snapshots for data persistence in
    case of server restart. These settings balance performance with data safety for
    your caching layer.


    Integrate Redis with Odoo for session storage and caching. Modify odoo.conf to
    include `http_session_redis = True` and set the Redis server connection parameters.
    This integration moves session management from the file system to memory, improving
    response times for authenticated users.


    ### Odoo Performance Tuning


    Configure Odoo''s worker processes for your hardware resources. Set `workers =
    4` in odoo.conf for a server with 4 CPU cores. Adjust this value based on your
    available processors and memory. Worker processes handle concurrent requests more
    efficiently than the default single-process mode.


    Optimize Odoo''s memory and timeout settings for stability. Set `limit_memory_hard
    = 2684354560` and `limit_memory_soft = 2147483648` to prevent worker memory leaks.
    Configure `limit_time_cpu` and `limit_time_real` to terminate long-running operations.
    These parameters protect your system from resource exhaustion.


    Enable Odoo''s built-in caching for frequently accessed data. Configure the `--cache-spec`
    parameter or use Redis for distributed caching. Caching reduces database queries
    for static or semi-static data like translations, company information, and user
    preferences.


    ### Database Optimization Techniques


    Implement PostgreSQL query optimization for Odoo''s specific workload. Create
    indexes on frequently searched fields like partner names, product codes, and invoice
    numbers. Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to identify slow queries and optimize them. Regular
    database maintenance ensures consistent performance.


    Schedule regular database maintenance tasks. Run `VACUUM ANALYZE` during low-traffic
    periods to update table statistics. Implement automatic index rebuilding for heavily
    updated tables. These maintenance activities prevent database bloat and maintain
    query performance over time.


    Monitor system resources to identify performance bottlenecks. Use tools like htop,
    nethogs, and iotop to track CPU, memory, network, and disk usage. Set up alerts
    for resource thresholds that might impact Odoo''s responsiveness. Proactive monitoring
    prevents performance degradation before users notice issues.'
