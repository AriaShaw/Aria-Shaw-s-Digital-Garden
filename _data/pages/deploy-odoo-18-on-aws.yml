  introduction: 'AWS''s lightsail instance delivers the compute and memory resources
    that Odoo 18 requires for production deployments serving 10-25 users. The 4 dedicated
    vCPUs handle concurrent user requests without CPU steal, while 8GB RAM provides
    sufficient headroom for PostgreSQL query caching.


    The technical foundation you establish today determines whether your Odoo system
    scales smoothly from ten users to one hundred, or requires disruptive infrastructure
    rebuilds when you hit performance ceilings. Configuration decisions during deployment—PostgreSQL
    tuning, worker process calculations, NGINX timeout settings—either provide growth
    headroom or create bottlenecks that demand expensive remediation later.'
  deployment_guide: 'The first decision determines your cost structure for the next
    year: which EC2 instance type matches your workload without overprovisioning.
    The t3.medium offers 2 vCPUs and 4GB RAM at $30.37 monthly on-demand, suitable
    for businesses with 10-30 users running standard Odoo modules like Sales, CRM,
    and Inventory. If your team exceeds 30 users or you''re deploying manufacturing
    or accounting modules with complex calculations, the m6i.large provides 8GB RAM
    at $89.28 monthly, which prevents the memory-swap thrashing that kills Odoo responsiveness
    under load. The wildcard option is the t4g.medium, an ARM-based Graviton instance
    at $24.30 monthly that delivers identical specs to the t3.medium but costs 20%
    less. The catch: you must verify your Odoo modules support ARM architecture, which
    most core modules do, but proprietary third-party addons may not.


    Launch your chosen instance through the EC2 console with Ubuntu 24.04 LTS as the
    base image. AWS provides official Ubuntu AMIs updated monthly, eliminating the
    malware-laden AMI risk that plagues community images. During launch configuration,
    create a new key pair for SSH access and download the private key immediately—AWS
    doesn''t store it, and you''ll need it for every future access. Attach a 50GB
    gp3 EBS volume as the root device instead of the default gp2; gp3 costs the same
    but provides 3,000 IOPS baseline versus gp2''s variable performance, which matters
    when PostgreSQL writes transaction logs during month-end closing processes.


    Security group configuration requires precision, not paranoia. Create a new security
    group with four inbound rules: SSH (port 22) restricted to your office IP address
    or VPN endpoint, HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) open to 0.0.0.0/0 for public
    access, and port 8069 open to 0.0.0.0/0 temporarily during initial setup. That
    last rule enables direct Odoo access for testing before you configure reverse
    proxy SSL termination. After SSL works, delete the 8069 rule entirely. Many guides
    leave it open permanently, creating an unencrypted access vector that bypasses
    your HTTPS enforcement. The outbound rules can remain at the default "allow all"
    setting since EC2 instances need to reach package repositories and external APIs.


    Connect via SSH and begin the installation phase. You face a fundamental architecture
    choice: Docker Compose or native installation. Docker Compose offers faster initial
    deployment and easier version upgrades—you change one line in a docker-compose.yml
    file and restart containers. Native installation gives you deeper control over
    Python dependencies and system-level optimizations, plus it avoids the 10-15%
    performance overhead Docker networking layers introduce. For most AWS deployments,
    native installation makes sense because you''re already managing infrastructure—you''ve
    chosen EC2 over managed hosting precisely to maximize control. Install PostgreSQL
    16 locally first with apt, then add the Odoo 18 repository, install the odoo package,
    and configure it to bind to localhost only while you test functionality.


    The PostgreSQL decision carries operational weight. Self-hosting PostgreSQL on
    the same EC2 instance simplifies the architecture and eliminates the $15 monthly
    RDS cost, but puts database administration on your team. You''ll handle vacuum
    operations, index optimization, and backup verification yourself. RDS managed
    PostgreSQL removes those responsibilities and adds automated backups with point-in-time
    recovery, but introduces 2-4ms network latency between Odoo and the database that
    impacts report generation and bulk import operations. If your team lacks a database
    specialist and your Odoo instance handles under 100 concurrent users, RDS is the
    pragmatic choice. Launch a db.t3.micro with 20GB storage and enable automated
    backups with a 7-day retention window. Connect Odoo to RDS by updating the db_host,
    db_port, db_user, and db_password parameters in /etc/odoo/odoo.conf.


    SSL termination through Let''s Encrypt provides free certificates with automated
    renewal, but requires a reverse proxy. Install Nginx, create a server block that
    proxies requests from port 443 to Odoo''s port 8069, and run Certbot to obtain
    certificates for your domain. The critical configuration detail most guides omit:
    set proxy_read_timeout to 600 seconds in your Nginx server block. Odoo''s module
    installation and large report generation operations can take several minutes,
    and Nginx''s default 60-second timeout kills these requests prematurely, generating
    cryptic "bad gateway" errors. Add a cron job to run certbot renew daily—Let''s
    Encrypt certificates expire after 90 days, and the automated renewal only works
    if the cron job exists.


    AWS-specific optimizations start with EBS volume tuning. Enable EBS optimization
    on your EC2 instance through the console, which dedicates network bandwidth to
    storage traffic and prevents disk I/O from competing with Odoo''s HTTP traffic.
    Attach an IAM role to the instance with CloudWatch agent permissions, install
    the CloudWatch agent, and configure it to stream Odoo''s log files to CloudWatch
    Logs. This centralized logging proves essential when debugging issues across multiple
    Odoo worker processes—grepping local log files becomes unmanageable at scale.
    Create CloudWatch alarms for CPU utilization above 80% and available memory below
    500MB so you receive notification before performance degradation reaches users.


    The Reserved Instance decision happens after you validate the deployment. Run
    on-demand pricing for the first month while you confirm the instance size handles
    your actual workload and user count. If the t3.medium CPU stays below 40% and
    memory usage never exceeds 3GB, you overprovisioned and should downgrade to a
    t4g.small before purchasing a reservation. If CPU consistently hits 70% or memory
    approaches 90%, upgrade to an m6i.large before problems emerge. Once you''ve settled
    on the right size, purchase a one-year reserved instance through the EC2 console—you''ll
    pay the full year upfront or choose monthly payments at a slight premium. The
    36% savings compounds monthly, totaling $133 annually for a t3.medium reservation.


    The total monthly AWS cost for a production Odoo 18 deployment on a reserved t3.medium
    with self-hosted PostgreSQL runs approximately $35: $19.31 for the reserved instance,
    $5 for 50GB gp3 EBS storage, $3 for CloudWatch Logs and metrics, and $2-3 for
    data transfer assuming 30GB monthly outbound traffic. Switching to RDS adds $15
    for a db.t3.micro. These costs scale linearly—doubling your instance size to an
    m6i.large doubles the compute cost but leaves storage and transfer costs unchanged.
    The key insight: AWS infrastructure costs remain predictable and transparent,
    unlike managed Odoo hosting where pricing jumps in opaque tiers as your user count
    grows.

    '
  conclusion: 'The Deploy Odoo 18 on aws: Complete 2025 Guide system you deployed
    demonstrates that production-grade Odoo infrastructure doesn''t require managed
    service providers or enterprise support contracts. You configured every component
    yourself—from AWS firewall rules through PostgreSQL parameter tuning to Let''s
    Encrypt SSL automation—and gained operational knowledge that survives vendor changes,
    price increases, and service discontinuations.


    This hands-on deployment approach delivers advantages that extend beyond immediate
    cost savings. You understand exactly how Odoo connects to PostgreSQL, how NGINX
    handles SSL termination and request proxying, where log files accumulate, and
    which processes consume memory under load. That knowledge eliminates the helpless
    dependency on support tickets and vendor response times that paralyzes businesses
    when production issues emerge during month-end financial closes or customer deadline
    pressure.


    Your infrastructure now supports the next growth phase. The lightsail instance
    with 8GB RAM handles 10-25 users, and you know exactly how to upgrade to larger
    instance types when user counts exceed current capacity. The automated backup
    system protects against data loss. The monitoring foundation provides visibility
    into system health. You built infrastructure that serves business needs for years,
    not months—that durability and control define digital sovereignty.
