  introduction: 'You manage an eBay store that generates real revenue, but your operational
    systems strain under manual data entry. Each sale creates a cascade of tasks—updating
    inventory counts, processing orders, reconciling payments—that consumes hours
    your business needs for growth. Your Odoo 18 system holds powerful automation
    potential, yet it operates in a separate universe from your eBay marketplace.
    This disconnect forces your team to bridge the gap with spreadsheets and repetitive
    clerical work, introducing human error that corrupts inventory data and delays
    customer shipments.


    This guide delivers a complete technical blueprint for integrating eBay with Odoo
    18. You will construct a bidirectional data pipeline that automates your entire
    order-to-cash workflow. We cover the integration architecture, provide step-by-step
    configuration with actual code examples, and detail the data mapping specifications
    for eBay’s complex item attributes. The process demands careful planning and technical
    execution, but the result eliminates manual intervention.


    We focus on the specific technical challenges of connecting eBay’s RESTful APIs
    with Odoo’s ORM, not generic integration theory. You will learn how to handle
    eBay’s unique inventory model, synchronize order statuses, and manage product
    listings from a single Odoo interface. Prepare for a deep technical dive that
    transforms two separate systems into a unified commerce engine, freeing your team
    to focus on strategic growth instead of data entry tasks.'
  main_content: "## Integration Architecture and Data Flow\n\nThe eBay-Odoo integration\
    \ employs a hub-and-spoke architecture where Odoo acts as the central data hub.\
    \ This design establishes a single source of truth for product information, inventory\
    \ levels, and order data. eBay operates as a sales channel that sends orders and\
    \ receives product updates through a dedicated connector module. The architecture\
    \ prevents data conflicts and ensures consistency across all your business operations.\n\
    \nOdoo’s built-in eBay connector module provides the foundation, but most implementations\
    \ require custom development for specific business rules. The module uses Odoo’s\
    \ scheduled action framework to execute synchronization jobs at defined intervals.\
    \ These jobs call eBay’s REST APIs using OAuth 2.0 authentication, fetch new data,\
    \ transform it into Odoo’s data model, and then update relevant records. The entire\
    \ process maintains data integrity through robust error handling.\n\n### Data Flow\
    \ from eBay to Odoo\n\nNew eBay orders initiate the primary inbound data flow.\
    \ The connector polls eBay’s Order API every few minutes to retrieve recent sales.\
    \ Each order undergoes a transformation process that maps eBay-specific fields\
    \ to Odoo’s sales order structure. The system creates draft sales orders in Odoo\
    \ with complete line items, shipping addresses, and buyer notes. This automation\
    \ ensures your accounting team receives orders within minutes of the sale completion.\n\
    \n### Data Flow from Odoo to eBay\n\nInventory updates form the critical outbound\
    \ data flow. When stock levels change in Odoo—whether from purchase receipts,\
    \ manufacturing, or other sales channels—the connector pushes these changes to\
    \ eBay’s Inventory Item API. The system updates quantity and price information\
    \ for your active listings, preventing oversells. This bidirectional synchronization\
    \ maintains accurate inventory counts across all sales channels in near real-time.\n\
    \n### Webhook Implementation for Real-Time Updates\n\nWhile polling works for\
    \ most operations, webhooks provide instant notification for order creation. eBay’s\
    \ webhook system can push order notifications to your Odoo instance the moment\
    \ a sale occurs. This approach reduces the delay between sale and order processing\
    \ from minutes to seconds. The implementation requires a publicly accessible Odoo\
    \ instance with a custom controller endpoint to receive and validate these webhook\
    \ payloads.\n\n## Step-by-Step Configuration\n\n### Prerequisites and Environment Setup\n\
    \nBegin with a production-ready Odoo 18 instance that has a valid SSL certificate.\
    \ eBay’s API mandates HTTPS for all callback URLs, so a development instance without\
    \ proper SSL will fail. Install the Odoo eBay connector module from the Odoo App\
    \ Store, but prepare to customize it for your specific eBay business policies.\
    \ Create a dedicated system user in Odoo with appropriate permissions for sales,\
    \ inventory, and product management.\n\nNavigate to your eBay Developer Program\
    \ dashboard and create a new production application. Select the “Trading API”\
    \ scope along with “Sell Commerce” and “Sell Fulfillment” permissions. Note your\
    \ App ID (Client ID), Cert ID (Client Secret), and RuName (eBay Redirect URL name).\
    \ These credentials form the foundation of your OAuth 2.0 authentication flow\
    \ and must remain secure throughout the configuration process.\n\n### OAuth 2.0\
    \ Authentication Configuration\n\neBay's API uses a three-legged OAuth 2.0 flow\
    \ that requires user consent. Implement a custom controller in Odoo that generates\
    \ the authorization URL and handles the callback. The authorization URL must include\
    \ your App ID, RuName, and the required scopes. When eBay redirects back to your\
    \ Odoo instance with an authorization code, your controller must exchange this\
    \ code for a user access token and refresh token.\n\nStore these tokens securely\
    \ in Odoo’s database using the `ir.config_parameter` model with appropriate encryption.\
    \ The access token expires after two hours, but the refresh token remains valid\
    \ for eighteen months. Implement automatic token refresh logic in your scheduled\
    \ actions to prevent authentication failures. This code example shows the token\
    \ exchange process:\n\n```python\ndef get_ebay_tokens(self, authorization_code):\n\
    \    url = \"https://api.ebay.com/identity/v1/oauth2/token\"\n    headers = {'Content-Type':\
    \ 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'}\n    data = {\n        'grant_type': 'authorization_code',\n\
    \        'code': authorization_code,\n        'redirect_uri': self.ru_name\n \
    \   }\n    auth = (self.app_id, self.cert_id)\n    response = requests.post(url,\
    \ headers=headers, data=data, auth=auth)\n    if response.status_code == 200:\n\
    \        tokens = response.json()\n        self.write({\n            'access_token':\
    \ tokens['access_token'],\n            'refresh_token': tokens['refresh_token'],\n\
    \            'token_expiry': fields.Datetime.now() + timedelta(seconds=tokens['expires_in'])\n\
    \        })\n```\n\n### eBay Connector Module Configuration\n\nAccess the eBay\
    \ configuration section within Odoo’s Sales app. Create a new eBay connection\
    \ record and input your API credentials. Set the synchronization intervals based\
    \ on your sales volume—typical configurations poll for orders every 10 minutes\
    \ and update inventory every 15 minutes. Configure the default values for new\
    \ products, including categories, shipping policies, and return policies.\n\n\
    Map your Odoo warehouses to specific eBay locations to ensure accurate inventory\
    \ tracking. Define your payment methods to align eBay transactions with Odoo’s\
    \ accounting structure. Enable the specific eBay marketplace regions you target,\
    \ as each region may have unique API requirements or business policies. Test the\
    \ connection with eBay's API to verify your authentication setup works correctly.\n\
    \n### Product and Inventory Synchronization Setup\n\nConfigure the product export\
    \ settings to determine which Odoo products sync to eBay. Set up category mappings\
    \ between Odoo’s product categories and eBay’s extensive category taxonomy. Define\
    \ pricing rules that calculate eBay selling prices from your Odoo product costs,\
    \ including eBay’s commission and payment processing fees. Establish inventory\
    \ rules that reserve specific stock quantities for eBay sales.\n\nImplement variation\
    \ mapping for products with attributes like size or color. eBay requires specific\
    \ variation data in its Item Specifics format, so you must map Odoo’s product\
    \ attribute values to eBay’s accepted values. This complex mapping often requires\
    \ custom development for product categories with unique requirements. Test with\
    \ a few sample products before enabling full synchronization.\n\n### Order Import\
    \ and Fulfillment Configuration\n\nDefine how Odoo processes incoming eBay orders.\
    \ Set the default customer account for eBay sales and configure automatic partner\
    \ creation for new buyers. Establish payment method mappings that reconcile eBay’s\
    \ payment status with Odoo’s accounting workflow. Configure shipping carrier mappings\
    \ to ensure tracking numbers sync correctly between systems.\n\nSet up automatic\
    \ order workflow rules that transition eBay orders through Odoo’s sales process.\
    \ Define when orders should confirm automatically versus remaining in quotation\
    \ status. Configure the fulfillment feedback system that notifies eBay when orders\
    \ ship with tracking information. This closed-loop process ensures buyers receive\
    \ timely shipment notifications and protects your seller performance metrics.\n\
    \n## Data Mapping and Transformation\n\n### Product Data Model Alignment\n\neBay's\
    \ product data model differs significantly from Odoo’s simplified structure. While\
    \ Odoo stores basic product information like name, description, and SKU, eBay\
    \ requires extensive item specifics that vary by category. Map Odoo product fields\
    \ to eBay’s required and recommended item specifics using category-specific templates.\
    \ This transformation ensures your listings contain the detailed information buyers\
    \ expect.\n\nFor example, a smartphone listing on eBay requires specific fields\
    \ like “Brand,” “Model,” “Storage Capacity,” and “Network.” Create a mapping system\
    \ that extracts this information from Odoo product attributes or custom fields.\
    \ Implement value normalization to convert Odoo’s internal values to eBay’s accepted\
    \ values—such as mapping “64GB” to “64 GB” per eBay’s specification. This attention\
    \ to detail prevents listing errors.\n\n### Inventory and Pricing Transformation\n\
    \nOdoo manages inventory at the product variant level, while eBay tracks inventory\
    \ for each listing variation. Implement a quantity reservation system that accounts\
    \ for pending orders across all channels. Transform Odoo’s pricing structure to\
    \ include eBay-specific fees, shipping costs, and any promotional pricing. Calculate\
    \ the final eBay price using configurable rules that maintain your profit margins.\n\
    \nHandle multi-currency transactions by implementing real-time currency conversion\
    \ between Odoo’s base currency and the buyer’s currency. eBay listings often price\
    \ in local currencies, while Odoo typically operates in a single base currency.\
    \ Implement exchange rate APIs or use Odoo’s built-in currency rates to ensure\
    \ accurate pricing. This prevents revenue discrepancies due to currency fluctuations.\n\
    \n### Order Data Mapping Challenges\n\neBay order data arrives with buyer information,\
    \ shipping details, and line items that require careful mapping to Odoo’s sales\
    \ order model. Transform eBay’s combined order structure into Odoo’s separate\
    \ sales order and delivery order models. Map eBay’s order statuses to appropriate\
    \ Odoo stages—such as converting “PAID” to a confirmed sales order ready for picking.\n\
    \nAddress information presents particular complexity since eBay condenses buyer\
    \ addresses into a single field while Odoo separates street, city, and state.\
    \ Implement address parsing logic that intelligently splits eBay’s address string\
    \ into Odoo’s structured format. Handle international address formats that may\
    \ not align with Odoo’s default country-specific templates to ensure accurate\
    \ shipping labels.\n\n### Image and Media Handling\n\neBay listings support multiple\
    \ images, while Odoo typically stores a primary product image. Implement a system\
    \ that uploads Odoo product images to eBay’s picture service and generates hosted\
    \ image URLs. Manage eBay’s requirement for image uniformity across variations—such\
    \ as showing different colors of the same product with consistent background and\
    \ lighting.\n\nTransform Odoo’s HTML product descriptions to comply with eBay’s\
    \ HTML restrictions. Remove unsupported CSS and JavaScript while preserving formatting\
    \ and image placement. Implement character limit validation for critical fields\
    \ like product titles to prevent listing rejection. This media handling ensures\
    \ your eBay listings maintain professional presentation standards.\n\n## Error\
    \ Handling and Resilience\n\n### Common eBay API Errors\n\nThe eBay API returns specific\
    \ error codes that require targeted handling. Error code 21919301 indicates an\
    \ invalid category ID, which occurs when your category mapping becomes outdated.\
    \ Implement periodic category sync to refresh your local category cache. Error\
    \ code 10007 signals invalid shipping service selection, often due to regional\
    \ shipping policy changes.\n\nAuthentication errors like 93001 require immediate\
    \ attention to your token management system. Implement automatic token refresh\
    \ with exponential backoff for rate limit errors. Create alert systems that notify\
    \ administrators when authentication failures persist beyond automatic recovery\
    \ attempts. This proactive approach prevents extended synchronization outages.\n\
    \n### Data Validation and Conflict Resolution\n\nEstablish validation rules that\
    \ catch data inconsistencies before API submission. Validate product data against\
    \ eBay’s current category requirements using their compatibility API. Check inventory\
    \ quantities to prevent listing updates with negative stock levels. Verify that\
    \ pricing meets eBay’s minimum and maximum price rules for specific categories.\n\
    \nImplement conflict resolution for simultaneous updates from multiple sources.\
    \ When Odoo updates a product quantity while an eBay sale occurs, use timestamp-based\
    \ conflict resolution to determine the correct final value. Create audit logs\
    \ that track data changes from both systems to facilitate troubleshooting when\
    \ discrepancies occur. This prevents data corruption from race conditions.\n\n\
    ### Order Synchronization Failures\n\nOrder import failures often stem from missing\
    \ customer information or invalid shipping addresses. Implement fallback procedures\
    \ that create placeholder partners for orders with incomplete buyer data. Develop\
    \ address correction workflows that flag problematic addresses for manual review\
    \ while processing the remainder of the order. This ensures order processing continues\
    \ despite data quality issues.\n\nHandle partial order synchronization when some\
    \ line items fail to import. Create recovery procedures that identify and retry\
    \ failed items without duplicating successful ones. Implement order reconciliation\
    \ reports that highlight synchronization gaps for manual intervention. This granular\
    \ error handling prevents complete order processing stoppage due to single-line-item\
    \ failures.\n\n### System Resilience and Recovery\n\nDesign the integration to\
    \ withstand temporary eBay API outages. Implement retry mechanisms with increasing\
    \ delays between attempts. Store synchronization state persistently so the system\
    \ can resume from the point of failure after recovery. Create manual synchronization\
    \ triggers for critical periods like holiday sales events when automated systems\
    \ might encounter unusual loads.\n\nDevelop comprehensive recovery procedures\
    \ for extended outages. These procedures should include data reconciliation reports\
    \ that compare eBay and Odoo data to identify gaps. Create manual import/export\
    \ tools for emergency situations where automated systems require maintenance.\
    \ This business continuity planning ensures your operations continue during system\
    \ disruptions.\n\n## Testing and Validation\n\n### Development Sandbox Configuration\n\
    \nBegin testing with eBay’s Sandbox environment, which replicates the production\
    \ API without affecting live operations. Create sandbox accounts for both buyer\
    \ and seller testing. Configure a separate Odoo instance specifically for integration\
    \ testing. This isolated environment lets you validate the complete integration\
    \ lifecycle without risking production data.\n\nExecute comprehensive test scenarios\
    \ that cover all integration aspects. Create test products in Odoo and verify\
    \ they sync correctly to eBay Sandbox. Make test purchases using the buyer sandbox\
    \ account and confirm order import into Odoo. Update inventory levels in Odoo\
    \ and verify the changes reflect on eBay listings. This end-to-end validation\
    \ confirms all data flows work as intended.\n\n### Data Synchronization Validation\n\
    \nDevelop validation scripts that compare data between systems and report discrepancies.\
    \ Check product SKU mapping accuracy by verifying that Odoo products match the\
    \ correct eBay listings. Validate inventory synchronization by comparing available\
    \ quantities across both platforms. Verify pricing accuracy by ensuring Odoo’s\
    \ calculated eBay price matches the actual listing price.\n\nTest edge cases like\
    \ out-of-stock scenarios, price changes during order processing, and variant updates.\
    \ Create specific test cases for products with special requirements like adult\
    \ verification or geographic restrictions. Verify that product deactivations in\
    \ Odoo properly end eBay listings. This thorough testing prevents unexpected behavior\
    \ in production environments.\n\n### Order Processing Workflow Testing\n\nSimulate\
    \ the complete order lifecycle from multiple eBay marketplaces. Test order import\
    \ with various payment statuses to ensure proper financial accounting. Verify\
    \ that order cancellations on eBay sync correctly to Odoo and restore inventory.\
    \ Test partial refunds and returns to ensure they process through Odoo’s accounting\
    \ system appropriately.\n\nValidate fulfillment synchronization by updating tracking\
    \ information in Odoo and confirming it appears on eBay. Test the feedback system\
    \ that marks orders as shipped in both platforms. Create high-volume order tests\
    \ to evaluate system performance under load. This workflow validation ensures\
    \ your operational processes function smoothly after integration.\n\n### Performance\
    \ and Load Testing\n\nMeasure synchronization performance under realistic data\
    \ volumes. Time how long product catalog exports take with hundreds of SKUs. Test\
    \ order import performance during simulated peak sales periods. Establish performance\
    \ benchmarks for each integration component and monitor for degradation over time.\
    \ This performance validation prevents system slowdowns during critical business\
    \ periods.\n\nTest system behavior under API rate limiting to ensure your integration\
    \ respects eBay’s usage policies. Implement and verify backoff algorithms that\
    \ prevent account suspension due to excessive API calls. Validate that your error\
    \ handling maintains system stability during temporary performance issues. This\
    \ resilience testing ensures reliable operation under adverse conditions.\n\n\
    ## Security Considerations\n\n### API Credential Protection\n\nStore eBay API credentials\
    \ using Odoo’s encrypted parameters rather than in plain text configuration files.\
    \ Implement credential rotation procedures that periodically refresh your API\
    \ keys. Restrict access to integration configuration screens to authorized administrators\
    \ only. Audit credential usage to detect potential unauthorized access.\n\nSecure\
    \ the OAuth 2.0 token exchange process by validating state parameters to prevent\
    \ CSRF attacks. Implement proper session management for administrative users configuring\
    \ the integration. Use HTTPS for all communication with eBay’s APIs to prevent\
    \ eavesdropping on sensitive business data. These measures protect your eBay account\
    \ from unauthorized access.\n\n### Data Privacy and Compliance\n\neBay order data\
    \ contains personal buyer information that requires protection. Implement data\
    \ access controls that limit which Odoo users can view customer details. Establish\
    \ data retention policies that automatically purge sensitive information after\
    \ legal requirements expire. Encrypt personally identifiable information in database\
    \ backups and logs.\n\nEnsure your integration complies with regional data protection\
    \ regulations like GDPR or CCPA. Implement data processing agreements that govern\
    \ how buyer information transfers between systems. Create data export procedures\
    \ that fulfill subject access requests from eBay buyers. This compliance framework\
    \ protects your business from regulatory penalties.\n\n### System Access Controls\n\
    \nImplement role-based access control that limits integration management to authorized\
    \ personnel. Create separate user accounts for automated synchronization processes\
    \ with minimal required permissions. Audit integration activity logs regularly\
    \ to detect suspicious behavior. Restrict system access based on the principle\
    \ of least privilege to prevent data breaches.\n\nSecure the communication channel\
    \ between Odoo and eBay using TLS 1.2 or higher. Validate SSL certificates to\
    \ prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. Implement network security measures that\
    \ restrict incoming connections to your Odoo instance from trusted sources only.\
    \ These access controls protect your integrated system from external threats.\n\
    \n## Performance Optimization\n\n### API Call Efficiency\n\neBay imposes strict rate\
    \ limits that require efficient API usage. Implement batch operations for product\
    \ and inventory updates instead of individual API calls. Use eBay’s bulk inventory\
    \ update endpoints to modify multiple listings in a single request. Schedule non-critical\
    \ synchronizations during off-peak hours to conserve API capacity for time-sensitive\
    \ operations.\n\nCache frequently accessed but rarely changed data like eBay category\
    \ structures and shipping policies. Implement conditional requests using eBay’s\
    \ metadata to avoid transferring unchanged data. Use webhooks for real-time notifications\
    \ instead of frequent polling where possible. These optimizations reduce your\
    \ API consumption while maintaining synchronization accuracy.\n\n### Database Optimization\n\
    \nThe integration generates substantial database activity that can impact Odoo\
    \ performance. Implement database indexing on frequently queried fields like external\
    \ eBay IDs and synchronization timestamps. Archive old synchronization logs to\
    \ prevent database table bloat. Use Odoo’s built-in queue jobs for heavy processing\
    \ tasks to avoid blocking user interactions.\n\nOptimize Odoo’s ORM usage by selecting\
    \ only necessary fields during synchronization processes. Avoid search operations\
    \ on large datasets without proper domain filters. Implement read-only database\
    \ replicas for reporting queries that don’t require real-time data. These database\
    \ optimizations maintain system responsiveness during heavy integration activity.\n\
    \n### Synchronization Strategy Tuning\n\nAdjust synchronization frequency based\
    \ on data criticality and update patterns. Implement real-time synchronization\
    \ for inventory updates that prevent overselling while using less frequent updates\
    \ for product description changes. Create priority queues that process time-sensitive\
    \ operations like order import before background tasks like product sync.\n\n\
    Monitor synchronization performance metrics to identify bottlenecks. Measure the\
    \ time between eBay order creation and Odoo import to establish performance baselines.\
    \ Track API response times to detect eBay service degradation. Implement alerting\
    \ when synchronization delays exceed acceptable thresholds. This performance monitoring\
    \ ensures your integration maintains service level objectives."
