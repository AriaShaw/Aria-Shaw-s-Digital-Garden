  main_content: "## System Architecture and Component Relationships\n\nOdoo 18 operates\
    \ on a multi-tier architecture that separates presentation, application logic,\
    \ and data storage layers. The web interface communicates with the Odoo application\
    \ server, which processes business logic and manages database interactions. PostgreSQL\
    \ serves as the primary data store, handling all transactional data, while the\
    \ file system stores documents and attachments.\n\nThe installation stack begins\
    \ with Ubuntu 22.04 as the operating system foundation. We install PostgreSQL\
    \ 15 from the official repositories, providing database services with optimal\
    \ performance characteristics. Python 3.10 serves as the runtime environment for\
    \ Odoo's application code, executed within a dedicated virtual environment that\
    \ isolates package dependencies.\n\nThe component communication follows specific\
    \ protocols. The Odoo server connects to PostgreSQL using psycopg2, the standard\
    \ PostgreSQL adapter for Python. NGINX functions as a reverse proxy, handling\
    \ incoming HTTP requests and forwarding them to the Odoo application server running\
    \ on a local socket or TCP port.\n\nThe architecture supports horizontal scaling\
    \ through additional application servers connected to a shared PostgreSQL database.\
    \ Each component maintains distinct responsibilities, with clear interfaces between\
    \ layers. This separation enables individual component upgrades, specialized optimization,\
    \ and targeted troubleshooting when issues emerge.\n\n### Process Flow and Data\
    \ Handling\n\nUser requests initiate a structured processing sequence. NGINX receives\
    \ HTTP/HTTPS requests and proxies them to the Odoo application server via Unix\
    \ socket or local port connection. The Odoo server processes the request through\
    \ its middleware stack, executing business logic and generating database queries\
    \ as needed.\n\nPostgreSQL processes these queries, returning result sets to the\
    \ Odoo application layer. The application server formats the data into HTML responses\
    \ or JSON API payloads, which NGINX delivers to the client browser. This request-response\
    \ cycle maintains stateless operation at the web server level, with session state\
    \ managed within the Odoo application.\n\nFile storage follows a dual-path approach.\
    \ Database records store structured data like customer information, products,\
    \ and transactions. The file system retains binary attachments, documents, and\
    \ generated reports, with Odoo maintaining reference pointers between database\
    \ records and their associated files.\n\n### Component Dependencies and Requirements\n\
    \nThe architecture imposes specific version requirements and compatibility constraints.\
    \ Odoo 18 mandates Python 3.8 through 3.11, with Python 3.10 delivering optimal\
    \ performance on Ubuntu 22.04. PostgreSQL 12 or newer provides database services,\
    \ though PostgreSQL 15 offers significant performance improvements for concurrent\
    \ operations.\n\nSystem libraries like libxml2, libxslt, and libevent provide\
    \ essential functionality for XML processing, document generation, and event-driven\
    \ programming. Python packages including Pillow for image processing, reportlab\
    \ for PDF generation, and NumPy for numerical computations extend Odoo's core\
    \ capabilities.\n\nThe package dependency tree requires careful management to\
    \ prevent conflicts. The virtual environment isolates Odoo's Python dependencies\
    \ from system packages, ensuring consistent operation regardless of system updates.\
    \ This isolation becomes critical when maintaining multiple Odoo instances or\
    \ different versions on the same server.\n\n## System Preparation and Dependency\
    \ Installation\n\nUbuntu 22.04 requires specific preparation before Odoo installation.\
    \ Begin with a comprehensive system update to ensure all existing packages current.\
    \ Execute `apt update` followed by `apt upgrade` to apply the latest security\
    \ patches and bug fixes. Reboot the system if the kernel receives updates during\
    \ this process.\n\nInstall the essential software packages that support Odoo's\
    \ operation. The package list includes development tools, database components,\
    \ and system libraries necessary for Python package compilation. Use this command\
    \ to install the foundational dependencies: `apt install -y git curl wget build-essential\
    \ libsasl2-dev libldap2-dev libssl-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libpq-dev python3-dev\
    \ python3-pip python3-venv python3-wheel`\n\nPostgreSQL installation requires\
    \ the official repository to ensure version compatibility. Add the PostgreSQL\
    \ global development group repository with `wget -q -O - https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc\
    \ | sudo apt-key add -` and `echo \"deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/\
    \ $(lsb_release -cs)-pgdg main\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list`.\
    \ Update the package cache and install PostgreSQL 15 using `apt install -y postgresql-15\
    \ postgresql-client-15 postgresql-server-dev-15`.\n\nCreate the system user that\
    \ will run the Odoo service. This user should possess minimal privileges, following\
    \ security best practices for service accounts. Execute `useradd -m -d /opt/odoo\
    \ -U -r -s /bin/bash odoo` to create the user with a home directory at /opt/odoo.\
    \ This directory will contain the Odoo source code, virtual environment, and configuration\
    \ files.\n\n### PostgreSQL Database Configuration\n\nSwitch to the postgres system\
    \ account to configure the database cluster. Execute `su - postgres` to assume\
    \ the database administrator identity. Create the Odoo database user with the\
    \ command `createuser --createdb --username postgres --no-createrole --no-superuser\
    \ --pwprompt odoo`. Provide a strong password when prompted, storing it securely\
    \ for later use.\n\nValidate the database user creation with `psql -c \"SELECT\
    \ usename FROM pg_user WHERE usename = 'odoo'\"`. The command should return a\
    \ single row containing the odoo username. Test the authentication by attempting\
    \ connection as the odoo user: `psql -h localhost -U odoo postgres`. Exit the\
    \ postgres account after completing these verification steps.\n\nConfigure PostgreSQL\
    \ connection security to permit the Odoo service account to connect. Edit /etc/postgresql/15/main/pg_hba.conf\
    \ and verify the local connection method includes \"md5\" authentication. The\
    \ line should read \"local all all md5\" for socket connections and \"host all\
    \ all 127.0.0.1/32 md5\" for TCP connections. Restart PostgreSQL with `systemctl\
    \ restart postgresql` to apply changes.\n\n### Python Environment Setup\n\nCreate\
    \ the Python virtual environment within the Odoo user's home directory. Switch\
    \ to the odoo service account using `su - odoo`. Execute `python3 -m venv odoo-venv`\
    \ to create an isolated Python environment at /opt/odoo/odoo-venv. Activate this\
    \ environment with `source odoo-venv/bin/activate` - your command prompt should\
    \ reflect the activation.\n\nUpgrade the core Python packaging tools within the\
    \ virtual environment. Run `pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel` to ensure\
    \ modern versions of these foundational packages. This step prevents compatibility\
    \ issues when installing Odoo's Python dependencies, particularly with binary\
    \ packages that require compilation.\n\nInstall the additional system dependencies\
    \ that support Python package compilation. Some Odoo dependencies require development\
    \ headers for successful building. Install these packages while operating as the\
    \ root user: `apt install -y libjpeg-dev libfreetype6-dev zlib1g-dev libopenjp2-7\
    \ liblcms2-dev libharfbuzz-dev libfribidi-dev`. Return to the odoo user account\
    \ after completing these installations.\n\n## Odoo Source Code Installation and\
    \ Configuration\n\nDownload the Odoo 18 source code from the official GitHub repository.\
    \ Ensure you operate as the odoo service account with the virtual environment\
    \ active. Clone the source code using `git clone https://github.com/odoo/odoo.git\
    \ odoo-18 --depth 1 --branch 18.0`. The --depth 1 parameter creates a shallow\
    \ clone with only the most recent commit history, conserving disk space.\n\nInstall\
    \ the Python dependencies specified in Odoo's requirements.txt file. Navigate\
    \ to the odoo-18 directory and execute `pip install -r requirements.txt`. This\
    \ process downloads and compiles numerous packages, including cryptography libraries,\
    \ database adapters, and reporting components. Expect the installation to require\
    \ five to ten minutes depending on system resources.\n\nVerify the Odoo installation\
    \ by attempting to start the application in direct mode. Execute `python odoo-bin\
    \ --help` to confirm the core application loads without errors. The command should\
    \ display Odoo's help information, confirming the Python environment contains\
    \ all necessary dependencies. Do not proceed if this test produces import errors\
    \ or missing dependency warnings.\n\n### Odoo Configuration File Creation\n\n\
    Create the Odoo configuration file at /opt/odoo/odoo-18.conf. This file controls\
    \ application behavior, database connections, and system resource allocation.\
    \ Use a text editor to create the file with these essential parameters:\n\n[options]\n\
    admin_passwd = your_secure_master_password\ndb_host = localhost\ndb_port = 5432\n\
    db_user = odoo\ndb_password = your_database_password\naddons_path = /opt/odoo/odoo-18/addons\n\
    data_dir = /var/lib/odoo\nlogfile = /var/log/odoo/odoo-18.log\nlog_level = info\n\
    proxy_mode = True\nwithout_demo = all\n\nSet strict file permissions on the configuration\
    \ file to protect database credentials. Execute `chmod 640 /opt/odoo/odoo-18.conf`\
    \ and `chown odoo:odoo /opt/odoo/odoo-18.conf`. These permissions prevent unauthorized\
    \ users from viewing the database password and master administration security\
    \ key.\n\nCreate the log directory and data directory with proper ownership. Execute\
    \ these commands as root: `mkdir /var/log/odoo` and `chown odoo:odoo /var/log/odoo`.\
    \ Create the data directory with `mkdir /var/lib/odoo` and `chown odoo:odoo /var/lib/odoo`.\
    \ These directories store application logs and generated files like session data\
    \ and attachments.\n\n### Systemd Service Configuration\n\nCreate a systemd service\
    \ file to manage Odoo as a system service. Create /etc/systemd/system/odoo-18.service\
    \ with these contents:\n\n[Unit]\nDescription=Odoo 18 ERP\nAfter=postgresql.service\n\
    \n[Service]\nType=simple\nUser=odoo\nGroup=odoo\nExecStart=/opt/odoo/odoo-venv/bin/python3\
    \ /opt/odoo/odoo-18/odoo-bin -c /opt/odoo/odoo-18.conf\nKillMode=mixed\nRestart=on-failure\n\
    RestartSec=5s\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n\nReload the systemd manager\
    \ configuration to recognize the new service. Execute `systemctl daemon-reload`\
    \ to load the service definition. Enable the Odoo service to start automatically\
    \ at boot with `systemctl enable odoo-18`. Start the service immediately with\
    \ `systemctl start odoo-18` and verify its status using `systemctl status odoo-18`.\n\
    \nCheck the Odoo log file to confirm successful startup. Execute `tail -f /var/log/odoo/odoo-18.log`\
    \ and watch for these key messages: \"Odoo version 18.0\" and \"Database odoo18\
    \ initialized\". The log should not contain Python tracebacks or database connection\
    \ errors. Address any issues before proceeding to the web configuration.\n\n##\
    \ NGINX Reverse Proxy Configuration\n\nNGINX functions as a reverse proxy, handling\
    \ SSL termination and static file serving. Install NGINX using `apt install -y\
    \ nginx`. Create a new configuration file at /etc/nginx/sites-available/odoo-18\
    \ with these directives:\n\nserver {\n    listen 80;\n    server_name your-domain.com;\n\
    \    \n    location / {\n        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8069;\n        proxy_set_header\
    \ Host $host;\n        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;\n        proxy_set_header\
    \ X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;\n        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto\
    \ $scheme;\n    }\n    \n    location /longpolling {\n        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8072;\n\
    \    }\n}\n\nEnable the site configuration by creating a symbolic link to the\
    \ sites-enabled directory. Execute `ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/odoo-18 /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/odoo-18`.\
    \ Remove the default NGINX configuration with `rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default`\
    \ to prevent conflicts.\n\nTest the NGINX configuration with `nginx -t`. The command\
    \ should report \"syntax is okay\" and \"test is successful\". Restart NGINX to\
    \ apply the new configuration using `systemctl restart nginx`. Configure the firewall\
    \ to permit HTTP traffic with `ufw allow 80/tcp`.\n\n### SSL Certificate Implementation\n\
    \nSecure the Odoo installation with SSL encryption using Let's Encrypt certificates.\
    \ Install Certbot and the NGINX plugin with `apt install -y certbot python3-certbot-nginx`.\
    \ Obtain and install the SSL certificate by executing `certbot --nginx -d your-domain.com`.\
    \ Follow the interactive prompts to complete the certificate installation.\n\n\
    Certbot automatically modifies the NGINX configuration to include SSL directives\
    \ and redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS. Verify the automatic renewal process works\
    \ with `certbot renew --dry-run`. This test ensures certificate renewal will occur\
    \ automatically before expiration.\n\nModify the Odoo configuration file to recognize\
    \ the reverse proxy setup. Add these parameters to the [options] section in /opt/odoo/odoo-18.conf:\n\
    \nproxy_mode = True\nx_sendfile = True\n\nRestart the Odoo service to apply these\
    \ changes with `systemctl restart odoo-18`. Test the SSL configuration by accessing\
    \ your domain with HTTPS in a web browser. The browser should display a secure\
    \ connection without certificate warnings.\n\n## Database Management and Module\
    \ Installation\n\nAccess the Odoo database management interface by navigating\
    \ to http://your-domain.com/web/database/manager. Create a new database by specifying\
    \ a name, selecting the appropriate language, and choosing demonstration data\
    \ preferences. Use a descriptive database name that identifies the environment\
    \ and purpose, such as \"company_production\" or \"company_staging\".\n\nOdoo\
    \ creates the database schema, tables, and initial data during this process. The\
    \ operation requires several minutes as Odoo installs core modules and creates\
    \ the administrative account. Monitor the Odoo log file during this process to\
    \ identify any potential issues: `tail -f /var/log/odoo/odoo-18.log`.\n\nThe database\
    \ creation process establishes the fundamental structure for all Odoo applications.\
    \ Core modules including base, mail, and web create the framework that supports\
    \ business applications. Each additional module extends this foundation with specific\
    \ functionality like accounting, inventory, or manufacturing capabilities.\n\n\
    ### Module Installation and Configuration\n\nInstall Odoo applications through\
    \ the web interface or command-line tools. Access the Apps menu within Odoo and\
    \ browse available applications. Use the search functionality to locate specific\
    \ modules like \"Accounting\", \"Inventory\", or \"Website Builder\". Click the\
    \ Install button to add each application to your database.\n\nSome modules require\
    \ dependencies that Odoo installs automatically. The system displays dependency\
    \ information during the installation process. Complex implementations may require\
    \ specific installation sequences - always install financial modules before operational\
    \ applications to ensure proper chart of accounts configuration.\n\nConfigure\
    \ each module after installation through their respective settings menus. The\
    \ Accounting module requires company information, fiscal year settings, and chart\
    \ of accounts selection. The Inventory module needs warehouse definitions, operation\
    \ types, and routing configurations. Complete these foundational settings before\
    \ entering transactional data.\n\n### Database Backup and Recovery\n\nImplement\
    \ a robust backup strategy for Odoo databases. Use Odoo's built-in backup functionality\
    \ through the database management interface or employ PostgreSQL native tools.\
    \ Schedule regular backups with `pg_dump -Fc -U odoo database_name > /path/to/backup/backup_file.dump`\
    \ executed via cron job.\n\nTest the backup restoration process to verify data\
    \ recoverability. Create a test database and restore a backup file to validate\
    \ the procedure. Use `pg_restore -d test_database backup_file.dump` to restore\
    \ the backup. Compare record counts between the original and restored databases\
    \ to ensure completeness.\n\nMonitor database growth and performance metrics.\
    \ Odoo databases expand rapidly with transaction history and document storage.\
    \ Implement a retention policy that archives or purses historical data according\
    \ to business requirements. Use PostgreSQL maintenance operations like VACUUM\
    \ and REINDEX to maintain performance.\n\n## Security Hardening and Access Control\n\nImplement comprehensive security measures to protect your Odoo installation.\
    \ Begin with the master administrator password in the Odoo configuration file.\
    \ This password controls access to the database management interface and should\
    \ exceed 16 characters with mixed character classes. Store the password securely\
    \ and restrict configuration file access.\n\nConfigure the Odoo access control\
    \ parameters to limit system exposure. Set `list_db = False` in the configuration\
    \ file to hide database listings from unauthenticated users. Implement `dbfilter\
    \ = ^your_database_name$` to restrict database access to specific naming patterns.\
    \ These measures prevent unauthorized database enumeration attempts.\n\nEstablish\
    \ strong password policies for user accounts. Odoo includes configurable password\
    \ security requirements in the General Settings menu. Enable minimum length requirements,\
    \ character complexity rules, and expiration periods according to your organizational\
    \ security standards. Consider implementing two-factor authentication for administrative\
    \ accounts.\n\n### Network Security Configuration\n\nConfigure the firewall to\
    \ permit only essential network traffic. Allow SSH (port 22), HTTP (port 80),\
    \ and HTTPS (port 443) while denying all other incoming connections. Use `ufw\
    \ enable` followed by `ufw allow 22,80,443/tcp` to implement these rules. Consider\
    \ restricting SSH access to specific source IP ranges for additional security.\n\
    \nImplement fail2ban to protect against brute force attacks. Install with `apt\
    \ install -y fail2ban` and create a custom jail for Odoo authentication attempts.\
    \ Create /etc/fail2ban/jail.d/odoo.conf with these parameters:\n\n[odoo]\nenabled\
    \ = true\nport = 8069,8072\nfilter = odoo\nlogpath = /var/log/odoo/odoo-18.log\n\
    maxretry = 5\nbantime = 3600\n\nCreate the corresponding filter at /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/odoo.conf:\n\
    \n[Definition]\nfailregex = ^.* WARNING odoo http: Login failed for db:.* login:.*\
    \ from <HOST>\nignoreregex =\n\nRestart fail2ban with `systemctl restart fail2ban`\
    \ and monitor its operation with `fail2ban-client status odoo`. The service should\
    \ detect failed login attempts and implement temporary IP address bans.\n\n###\
    \ System Maintenance and Updates\n\nEstablish a regular maintenance schedule for\
    \ system updates and security patches. Subscribe to Ubuntu security notifications\
    \ and Odoo security advisories to stay informed about vulnerabilities. Test updates\
    \ in a staging environment before applying them to production systems.\n\nMonitor\
    \ system logs and Odoo application logs for suspicious activity. Implement log\
    \ rotation to prevent disk space exhaustion while retaining sufficient history\
    \ for forensic analysis. Use `logrotate` to manage log files, creating /etc/logrotate.d/odoo\
    \ with appropriate retention settings.\n\nPerform regular security audits of user\
    \ accounts and access permissions. Review Odoo user roles and access rights monthly\
    \ to ensure compliance with the principle of least privilege. Remove inactive\
    \ accounts and limit administrative access to essential personnel only.\n\n##\
    \ Performance Optimization and Monitoring\n\nOptimize PostgreSQL configuration\
    \ for Odoo's workload characteristics. Edit /etc/postgresql/15/main/postgresql.conf\
    \ and adjust these key parameters:\n\nshared_buffers = 25% of system RAM\nwork_mem\
    \ = 50MB\nmaintenance_work_mem = 512MB\neffective_cache_size = 50% of system RAM\n\
    checkpoint_completion_target = 0.9\nrandom_page_cost = 1.1\n\nRestart PostgreSQL\
    \ after making these changes with `systemctl restart postgresql`. Monitor database\
    \ performance using PostgreSQL's built-in statistics collector and query analysis\
    \ tools. Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` on slow queries to identify optimization opportunities.\n\
    \nConfigure Odoo's built-in caching mechanisms to reduce database load. Set `osv_memory_count_limit\
    \ = 2000000000` in the configuration file to increase the in-memory cache size.\
    \ Enable `workers = 4` to utilize multiple processor cores for concurrent request\
    \ handling. Adjust the worker count based on available CPU cores and system memory.\n\
    \nImplement a dedicated file storage system for Odoo attachments and session data.\
    \ Use high-performance storage with adequate IOPS capacity for the expected user\
    \ load. Consider implementing a distributed file system for multi-server deployments\
    \ or high-availability configurations.\n\n### System Monitoring and Alerting\n\
    \nInstall and configure monitoring tools to track system health and performance.\
    \ Use Prometheus with node_exporter for system metrics and PostgreSQL exporter\
    \ for database performance data. Configure Grafana dashboards to visualize key\
    \ performance indicators including response times, database connections, and system\
    \ resource utilization.\n\nSet up alerting for critical system conditions. Monitor\
    \ disk space usage, memory consumption, and CPU load to prevent resource exhaustion.\
    \ Configure database connection pool usage alerts to detect application issues\
    \ before they impact users. Use Odoo's built-in monitoring endpoint at /web/database/monitor\
    \ for basic health checks.\n\nImplement log aggregation and analysis to identify\
    \ performance patterns and error conditions. Use the ELK stack (Elasticsearch,\
    \ Logstash, Kibana) or Graylog to centralize log data from Odoo, PostgreSQL, and\
    \ system components. Create alerts for specific error patterns that indicate system\
    \ degradation or security issues.\n\n### Regular Maintenance Procedures\n\nSchedule\
    \ regular database maintenance during low-usage periods. Perform VACUUM ANALYZE\
    \ operations weekly to update table statistics and reclaim storage space. Rebuild\
    \ indexes quarterly to maintain query performance as data volumes increase. Monitor\
    \ table bloat and transaction ID wraparound risks.\n\nEstablish a performance\
    \ testing regimen for major configuration changes. Use tools like Apache JMeter\
    \ to simulate user loads and measure response times under various conditions.\
    \ Maintain a staging environment that mirrors production specifications for accurate\
    \ performance validation.\n\nReview and optimize custom code and reports regularly.\
    \ Complex SQL queries and Python code can introduce performance bottlenecks as\
    \ data volumes grow. Use Odoo's built-in profiling tools to identify slow operations\
    \ and optimize database access patterns in custom modules."
