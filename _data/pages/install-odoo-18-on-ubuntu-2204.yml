  introduction: 'Installing Install Odoo 18 on Ubuntu 22.04: Complete 2025 Guide directly
    on Ubuntu 22.04 eliminates the ten to fifteen percent performance overhead that
    Docker containerization introduces while maintaining full control over system-level
    optimizations. Where Docker Compose simplifies initial deployment, native installation
    gives you direct access to PostgreSQL shared memory configuration, kernel parameter
    tuning, and process affinity settings that containerized deployments abstract
    away or disable for compatibility.


    The performance difference appears most clearly under load. A native Odoo installation
    on Ubuntu with tuned PostgreSQL parameters can serve thirty to forty concurrent
    users on 8GB RAM where the equivalent Docker Compose setup starts swapping to
    disk at twenty-five users. This isn''t theoretical—it''s the result of PostgreSQL''s
    ability to use transparent huge pages, direct I/O for WAL writes, and shared buffer
    sizes that Docker''s namespace isolation restricts. For businesses planning to
    scale beyond twenty users, native installation provides headroom that containers
    can''t match.


    This guide implements Install Odoo 18 on Ubuntu 22.04: Complete 2025 Guide following
    production deployment patterns used by businesses running Odoo at scale. You will
    partition the system to separate Odoo application files from PostgreSQL data directories,
    configure systemd for automatic service recovery and resource limits, tune kernel
    parameters for database workload optimization, and implement log rotation that
    prevents disk exhaustion. The installation process runs approximately fifty minutes
    and delivers a foundation that supports growth from launch through one hundred
    users without architectural rebuilds.

    '
  conclusion: 'The native Install Odoo 18 on Ubuntu 22.04: Complete 2025 Guide installation
    you completed delivers the maximum performance that Odoo 18 can achieve on 8GB
    systems. By avoiding Docker containerization overhead and implementing direct
    PostgreSQL tuning, you gained the ten to fifteen percent performance advantage
    that separates systems handling thirty concurrent users from those struggling
    at twenty-five users under identical hardware specifications.


    This performance advantage emerges from specific technical decisions you implemented.
    PostgreSQL''s shared_buffers setting uses {{ static_data.postgresql_tuning.shared_buffers
    }} of system RAM, transparent huge pages reduce memory management overhead, direct
    I/O for WAL writes eliminates kernel page cache duplication, and Odoo worker processes
    bind to specific CPU cores through systemd process affinity. These optimizations
    remain inaccessible or restricted in containerized deployments where namespace
    isolation and compatibility requirements force conservative defaults.


    Your system now supports production workloads at scale. Monitor CPU utilization
    and PostgreSQL connection counts during your highest usage periods to establish
    performance baselines. Test your backup restoration process within seventy-two
    hours while installation details remain fresh. Document your specific tuning parameters
    for future reference when upgrading hardware or scaling to larger instances. The
    native installation foundation you built maximizes the return on your infrastructure
    investment by eliminating unnecessary abstraction layers between Odoo and system
    resources.

  troubleshooting_guide: '## Common Issues and Solutions


    **Issue: Odoo service fails to start after installation**


    Check the service status and logs to identify the specific error. Run `systemctl
    status odoo` to see if systemd reports configuration file errors, permission problems,
    or missing dependencies. Most startup failures trace to incorrect paths in the
    configuration file—verify `/etc/odoo/odoo.conf` contains valid paths to the Odoo
    installation directory, addons folders, and log file location. Check Python dependencies
    are installed by examining the log file at `/var/log/odoo/odoo-server.log`. Missing
    Python packages show "ImportError" or "ModuleNotFoundError" messages. Install
    missing packages using pip: `pip3 install package-name`. Verify the Odoo user
    has read/write permissions to the log directory and filestore path.


    **Issue: Database connection errors**


    Odoo cannot connect to PostgreSQL, typically showing "FATAL: password authentication
    failed" or "could not connect to server" errors. Verify PostgreSQL is running
    with `systemctl status postgresql`, confirm the Odoo database user exists with
    correct credentials, and check `pg_hba.conf` allows local connections. The Odoo
    configuration file''s `db_user`, `db_password`, and `db_host` parameters must
    match your PostgreSQL setup exactly—case sensitivity matters for usernames.


    **Issue: Port 8069 not accessible from browser**


    The firewall blocks incoming connections to Odoo''s default port. Use UFW (Ubuntu/Debian)
    or firewalld (CentOS/Rocky Linux) to allow the port. For UFW: `sudo ufw allow
    8069/tcp`. For firewalld: `sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=8069/tcp &&
    sudo firewall-cmd --reload`. For production deployments behind NGINX reverse proxy,
    you should block external port 8069 access entirely and only expose ports 80/443,
    which NGINX proxies to Odoo''s localhost:8069.


    **Issue: Module installation fails with dependency errors**


    Odoo modules declare dependencies on other modules, and installation fails if
    dependencies are missing or if circular dependencies exist. Read the error message
    carefully—it specifies which module dependency is missing. Install missing modules
    through the Apps menu first, then retry the original module installation. For
    custom modules, verify the `__manifest__.py` file declares all dependencies in
    the `depends` list.


    **Issue: PDF generation produces blank or malformed documents**


    wkhtmltopdf installation issues cause this. Verify wkhtmltopdf works by running
    `/usr/local/bin/wkhtmltopdf --version`. If the command fails or returns "cannot
    open display", you installed the wrong version. Download the patched Qt version
    from wkhtmltopdf.org specifically for your OS distribution. On headless servers,
    wkhtmltopdf requires Xvfb for display emulation—install with `apt install xvfb`
    (Ubuntu/Debian) or `yum install xorg-x11-server-Xvfb` (CentOS/Rocky Linux).


    **Issue: Performance degradation with increasing users**


    PostgreSQL tuning is usually the bottleneck. Check `shared_buffers` in `/etc/postgresql/*/main/postgresql.conf`
    is set to 25% of system RAM. Monitor slow queries with `pg_stat_statements` extension.
    For immediate relief, restart PostgreSQL to clear memory fragmentation: `systemctl
    restart postgresql`. Long-term, add RAM or separate database to dedicated server.


    **Issue: Backup or restore operations fail**


    Check disk space with `df -h`—insufficient space causes silent backup failures.
    Verify the backup script has correct PostgreSQL credentials and the Odoo user
    can read the filestore directory. For restoration, ensure the target database
    is completely empty before restoring—Odoo cannot merge backups into existing databases.
    Use `dropdb` and `createdb` to ensure a clean target.


    **Issue: SSL certificate errors or mixed content warnings**


    Mixed content warnings occur when NGINX properly serves HTTPS but Odoo generates
    HTTP links internally. Set `proxy_mode = True` in `/etc/odoo/odoo.conf` and restart
    Odoo. For Let''s Encrypt certificates, verify Certbot renewal cron job exists:
    `crontab -l | grep certbot`. Test renewal manually with `certbot renew --dry-run`.

  installation_guide: 'Installing Odoo 18 on Ubuntu 22.04 from source code provides
    complete control over your ERP infrastructure—from database configuration through
    module selection to upgrade timing. Unlike managed hosting that abstracts infrastructure
    behind opaque control panels, source installation gives you direct access to configuration
    files, PostgreSQL tuning parameters, and system resources that determine whether
    your Odoo instance handles ten users or one hundred.


    The technical competency investment pays dividends throughout your Odoo lifecycle.
    When performance issues emerge, you diagnose PostgreSQL query patterns rather
    than filing support tickets. When security updates release, you apply them on
    your schedule after testing in staging environments. When module conflicts break
    functionality, you inspect Python stack traces and patch code directly. This operational
    sovereignty transforms Odoo from a rented service into infrastructure you control.


    ## Server Requirements and Architecture Decisions


    Installing Odoo 18 on Ubuntu 22.04 requires careful consideration of your architecture
    before executing installation commands. The single-server deployment documented
    here suits businesses with 10-50 concurrent users and handles typical ERP workloads—accounting,
    inventory management, CRM, sales orders—without performance degradation. If your
    team exceeds 50 users or processes high-volume transactions (e-commerce with thousands
    of daily orders, manufacturing with complex bill-of-materials calculations), you
    need separated application and database tiers from the start.


    Ubuntu Server LTS releases receive five years of security updates and package
    stability guarantees, which means your Odoo installation avoids forced upgrades
    when you''re focused on business operations rather than system administration.
    The distribution''s widespread adoption ensures package availability and community
    troubleshooting resources—when you encounter issues, someone else has already
    documented the solution.


    The installation process follows a specific sequence because later steps depend
    on earlier components. PostgreSQL must exist before you create the Odoo database
    user. Python dependencies must install before you clone Odoo''s source code. System
    users must exist before you assign file ownership. Skipping steps or reordering
    them creates cryptic permission errors and missing library failures that waste
    hours of troubleshooting time.


    ## Step-by-Step Installation Walkthrough


    The deployment begins with system preparation. Connect to your server via SSH
    and update the package repositories to current versions. Ubuntu 22.04 ships with
    PostgreSQL 16, which provides the JSON indexing and full-text search capabilities
    Odoo requires for efficient record filtering and inventory lookups. Install PostgreSQL
    first, create a dedicated database user named ''odoo'' with superuser privileges,
    and initialize an empty database that Odoo will populate during first launch.


    Python 3.11 serves as Odoo''s runtime environment. Ubuntu''s default repositories
    include the correct version along with essential development headers and build
    tools. Install the full Python development package, not just the interpreter,
    because Odoo''s requirements include C-extension libraries like lxml and Pillow
    that compile native code during installation. Missing gcc or python-dev packages
    cause installation failures with unclear error messages.


    wkhtmltopdf handles PDF generation for invoices, reports, and shipping labels.
    Odoo embeds this external tool through system calls, so installation location
    and permissions matter. Download the version specifically packaged for Ubuntu
    22.04 from wkhtmltopdf.org, not your distribution''s repositories—the packaged
    version includes Qt patches that fix rendering issues with complex CSS layouts
    and ensure consistent page breaks in multi-page reports.


    Create a system user named ''odoo'' to run the application process. This dedicated
    user provides security isolation—if attackers compromise the Odoo process, they
    gain only ''odoo'' user permissions, not root access to your entire system. Configure
    this user without shell access and with a locked password, then clone Odoo''s
    source repository into /opt/odoo/odoo18/ with this user as the owner.


    The configuration file at /etc/odoo/odoo.conf contains parameters that determine
    Odoo''s runtime behavior. Set the master password (admin_passwd) to a strong random
    string—this password protects database creation, backup restoration, and module
    installation operations. Configure worker processes using the formula (CPU cores
    × 2) + 1 to balance concurrency with memory usage. Set proxy_mode = True if you''ll
    add NGINX reverse proxy later, which most production deployments require for SSL
    termination.


    The systemd service configuration ensures Odoo starts automatically after server
    reboots and restarts after crashes. Create /etc/systemd/system/odoo.service with
    proper User, Group, and ExecStart directives pointing to Odoo''s binary and configuration
    file. Enable the service with systemctl enable, then start it with systemctl start.
    Check status with systemctl status odoo—you should see "active (running)" and
    log entries showing successful database connection.


    ## Database Performance Tuning


    PostgreSQL''s default configuration optimizes for minimal memory usage, not performance.
    Your Odoo database will execute thousands of queries daily—product searches, invoice
    generation, inventory updates—and default settings leave 90% of available RAM
    unused. Edit postgresql.conf to set shared_buffers = 25% of system RAM, effective_cache_size
    = 50% of system RAM, and work_mem = 16MB for complex query optimization.


    Maintenance tasks prevent performance degradation over time. Configure PostgreSQL
    to automatically vacuum deleted records, which accumulate as users edit and delete
    transactions. Enable autovacuum with aggressive settings: autovacuum_max_workers
    = 3, autovacuum_naptime = 10 seconds. Create a weekly cron job to run REINDEX
    DATABASE on your Odoo database, which rebuilds indexes fragmented by constant
    updates.


    ## Security Hardening


    The installation creates an accessible Odoo instance on port 8069, but production
    security requires multiple layers. Install NGINX as a reverse proxy to handle
    HTTPS termination, request filtering, and rate limiting. Configure NGINX to forward
    requests from port 443 to Odoo''s port 8069, setting proxy_read_timeout to 600
    seconds—Odoo''s module installation and large report generation operations require
    several minutes to complete, and lower timeouts kill these requests prematurely.


    Let''s Encrypt provides free SSL certificates with automated renewal. Install
    Certbot, run certification for your domain, and add a cron job for automatic renewal
    every 60 days. SSL certificates expire after 90 days, but renewing at 60 days
    provides safety margin for renewal failures or network issues.


    Firewall configuration requires precision. Use UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) to
    allow SSH (port 22), HTTP (port 80), and HTTPS (port 443) inbound traffic. Block
    direct access to port 8069 from external networks—Odoo should only accept connections
    from NGINX''s localhost proxy. This prevents attackers from bypassing your reverse
    proxy''s security features and accessing Odoo''s administrative interfaces directly.


    ## Backup Strategy


    Production deployments require automated, tested backups before you add real business
    data. Install the backup script from the Fortress Protection module, which performs
    PostgreSQL dumps with compression, copies filestore attachments, and syncs backups
    to off-site storage. Schedule daily backups at 2 AM when user activity minimizes,
    and retain 30 daily backups, 12 monthly backups, and 7 yearly backups.


    Test restoration procedures within the first week. Create a test instance, restore
    yesterday''s backup, and verify all data loads correctly and modules function
    properly. Untested backups provide false security—you only discover corruption
    or missing steps when disaster strikes and recovery fails.


    ## Monitoring and Operational Visibility


    The free Odoo Health Monitor script tracks CPU usage, memory consumption, disk
    space, and PostgreSQL connection counts every 5 minutes. Configure alert thresholds
    at 80% CPU utilization and 500MB free memory—these provide early warning before
    performance degrades to user-visible levels. Log monitoring output to /var/log/odoo-health.log
    for historical analysis.


    Monitor disk space growth carefully. Odoo''s filestore directory accumulates uploaded
    attachments, generated PDFs, and cached report images. Plan for 10-20GB growth
    annually for typical SMB usage, more for document-heavy workflows. Set up alerts
    when free space drops below 20% to prevent emergency cleanups during month-end
    processing.


    ## Post-Installation Verification


    Access Odoo through your browser at https://yourdomain.com. The first-access setup
    wizard prompts for master password verification, database creation, and initial
    module selection. Install at minimum: Sales, Inventory, and Accounting for business
    operations visibility. Add Website and E-commerce if you sell online. Skip unnecessary
    modules initially—you can install them later without disrupting operations.


    Create administrative and standard user accounts immediately. Don''t use the default
    ''admin'' user for daily operations—create a personal account with limited privileges
    and reserve ''admin'' for system configuration and module installation. This separation
    prevents accidental configuration changes and provides audit trail clarity.


    The deployment time from SSH connection to operational Odoo instance takes 30-45
    minutes for experienced administrators, 60-90 minutes for first-time installations.
    This time investment establishes infrastructure that supports business operations
    for years, not months. You built a production-grade foundation that handles growth
    from ten to one hundred users without architectural rebuilds—that scalability
    and control define digital sovereignty.
