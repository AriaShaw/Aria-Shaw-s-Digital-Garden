  main_content: '## Integration Architecture and Data Flow


    ### Core Integration Patterns


    The Kashoo-Odoo integration employs a hub-and-spoke architecture with Odoo 18
    as the central data hub. Kashoo functions as the accounting spoke, feeding financial
    data into Odoo''s operational ecosystem. This design pattern ensures Odoo maintains
    master data control while Kashoo specializes in Canadian accounting compliance
    and tax reporting. The integration uses bidirectional synchronization for reference
    data but implements a strict Kashoo-to-Odoo flow for transactional data.


    Odoo 18''s web engine provides the foundation with its modern JavaScript framework
    and improved REST API endpoints. The integration leverages Odoo''s new web controller
    system to create dedicated API routes for Kashoo webhooks. These endpoints receive
    accounting events from Kashoo and transform them into Odoo business objects. The
    architecture maintains data consistency through idempotent operations that prevent
    duplicate record creation.


    ### Data Flow Sequencing


    Financial data follows a specific sequence to maintain accounting integrity. Kashoo
    pushes new transactions through webhook notifications to Odoo''s designated endpoint.
    The integration service validates each webhook signature before processing. Odoo
    then makes API calls back to Kashoo to fetch complete transaction details, including
    line items and tax calculations. This two-step process ensures secure data transfer
    while minimizing the payload size of initial webhook notifications.


    The sync engine processes transactions in chronological order to maintain proper
    accounting periods. It queues transactions that arrive out-of-sequence and processes
    them once prior transactions complete. This sequencing prevents gaps in journal
    entry numbering and maintains accurate account balances. The system assigns Odoo-generated
    UUIDs to each imported transaction for audit trail purposes and duplicate detection.


    ### Authentication Framework


    Kashoo uses OAuth 2.0 with JWT tokens for API authentication, while Odoo 18 supports
    both API keys and session-based authentication. The integration implements a token
    refresh mechanism that automatically renews Kashoo access tokens before expiration.
    Odoo stores these credentials encrypted in its system parameters table with strict
    access controls. The authentication layer includes exponential backoff retry logic
    for handling temporary API outages.


    Each API call includes specific headers that identify the integration instance
    and its version. This header information assists with debugging and allows Kashoo''s
    API to track usage patterns. The system logs all authentication attempts and token
    refreshes for security auditing. Failed authentication attempts trigger immediate
    alerts to system administrators through Odoo''s notification system.


    ## Step-by-Step Configuration


    ### Odoo 18 Module Installation


    Begin by installing the accounting connector module in Odoo 18. Access your Odoo
    instance with administrator privileges and navigate to the Apps menu. Search for
    "Kashoo Connector" or install a custom module if you developed one internally.
    Enable developer mode to access technical settings required for integration configuration.
    The module adds new menu items under the Accounting section for Kashoo configuration.


    Create a new system parameter for Kashoo API configuration using Odoo''s technical
    menu. Navigate to Settings > Technical > Parameters > System Parameters. Create
    a record with key "kashoo.api.url" and value "https://api.kashoo.com". Add another
    parameter with key "kashoo.api.version" and value "v2". These parameters centralize
    API configuration and simplify future updates when Kashoo changes endpoints.


    The module creates new database tables for storing Kashoo synchronization metadata.
    These tables track the last successful sync timestamp, processed transaction counts,
    and error logs. Verify the table creation by checking the database structure in
    Odoo''s technical menu. The system uses these tables to resume synchronization
    from the point of failure during service interruptions.


    ### Kashoo Application Registration


    Log into your Kashoo account and navigate to Company Settings > API Access. Click
    "Create New App" to register Odoo as an authorized integration. Provide a descriptive
    name like "Odoo 18 Production Integration" and specify the redirect URI as your
    Odoo instance base URL plus "/kashoo/auth/callback". Kashoo generates a client
    ID and client secret that you must securely store for Odoo configuration.


    Kashoo presents scopes selection during app registration. Select "transactions:read",
    "accounts:read", "taxes:read", and "company:read" permissions. These scopes grant
    Odoo access to financial data without modification rights, following the principle
    of least privilege. Kashoo may require business verification for API access depending
    on your account type and transaction volumes.


    Configure webhook subscriptions in the Kashoo developer portal to push real-time
    notifications to Odoo. Subscribe to "transaction.created", "transaction.updated",
    and "transaction.deleted" events. Set the webhook endpoint URL to your Odoo instance
    base URL plus "/kashoo/webhook/transaction". Kashoo sends a verification request
    to this endpoint that must return a success response within five seconds.


    ### Odoo Integration Configuration


    Access the Kashoo configuration menu under Accounting > Settings > Kashoo Integration.
    Paste the client ID and client secret from your Kashoo app registration into the
    corresponding fields. Click "Authorize with Kashoo" to initiate the OAuth 2.0
    flow. Odoo redirects you to Kashoo''s authorization page where you grant permissions
    to the integration.


    The system stores the refresh token in encrypted format and automatically obtains
    access tokens for API calls. Test the connection by clicking "Verify Kashoo Connection".
    Odoo attempts to fetch your company profile from Kashoo and displays the company
    name upon success. This verification confirms that authentication works correctly
    and API endpoints are accessible.


    Configure synchronization settings based on your business requirements. Set the
    transaction sync start date to the beginning of your current fiscal year for complete
    historical data transfer. Enable "Auto-sync New Transactions" for real-time processing
    of accounting entries. Set the sync frequency to "Immediate" for production environments
    or "Hourly" for testing deployments with lower transaction volumes.


    ### Data Model Configuration


    Map your Kashoo accounts to Odoo''s chart of accounts using the account mapping
    interface. The system displays unmatched accounts from both systems and suggests
    mappings based on account names and types. Review each suggested mapping for accuracy,
    particularly for equity and retained earnings accounts. Canadian businesses must
    pay special attention to GST/HST liability accounts mapping.


    Configure tax mapping between Kashoo''s Canadian tax system and Odoo''s tax engine.
    Map Kashoo''s GST 5% to Odoo''s corresponding tax record, ensuring the tax account
    aligns with your chart of accounts. Create missing tax records in Odoo for Canadian
    provincial sales taxes that don''t exist in your current configuration. Test tax
    calculations with sample transactions to verify accurate tax amount synchronization.


    Set up payment method mapping to ensure proper payment reconciliation. Map Kashoo
    payment types like "Credit Card" and "Electronic Transfer" to Odoo''s payment
    methods. This mapping enables automatic reconciliation of customer payments and
    vendor disbursements. Configure default accounts for each payment method to streamline
    the reconciliation process for your accounting team.


    ### Webhook Security Configuration


    Implement webhook signature verification to ensure only Kashoo can push data to
    your Odoo instance. Retrieve the webhook secret from your Kashoo application settings
    and add it to Odoo''s system parameters with key "kashoo.webhook.secret". The
    integration module uses this secret to validate the SHA256 signature of incoming
    webhook requests.


    Configure webhook retry settings in Kashoo''s developer portal to handle temporary
    Odoo outages. Set the maximum retry attempts to five with exponential backoff
    over twenty-four hours. This configuration ensures temporary network issues don''t
    cause permanent data loss. Monitor webhook delivery statistics in the Kashoo dashboard
    to identify persistent delivery problems.


    Test webhook functionality by creating a test transaction in Kashoo and verifying
    its appearance in Odoo. Use Kashoo''s "Send Test Webhook" feature to verify your
    endpoint configuration without creating actual transactions. The test webhook
    sends a mock payload that should trigger a success response from your Odoo instance.
    Address any errors before proceeding to production data synchronization.


    ## Data Mapping and Transformation


    ### Chart of Accounts Alignment


    Kashoo''s default chart of accounts follows Canadian accounting standards, while
    Odoo uses International Financial Reporting Standards. This divergence requires
    careful mapping to maintain accurate financial reporting. Start with revenue accounts
    by mapping Kashoo''s "Product Sales" to Odoo''s "Sales - Products" account. Continue
    with expense accounts, paying particular attention to payroll and benefits accounts
    that have different structures between the systems.


    Map balance sheet accounts with special consideration for equity accounts. Kashoo
    typically uses "Share Capital" and "Retained Earnings" while Odoo employs "Common
    Stock" and "Reserves". Create account groups in Odoo that mirror Kashoo''s structure
    if your financial reporting requires specific Canadian accounting presentations.
    Use Odoo''s account tags feature to maintain additional reporting dimensions that
    Kashoo supports natively.


    Handle bank account mapping by linking Kashoo''s bank accounts to Odoo''s liquidity
    accounts. The integration should create Odoo journal entries that reflect the
    same bank account structure as your Kashoo setup. This consistency ensures bank
    reconciliation works seamlessly between both systems. Map credit card accounts
    as liability accounts in Odoo with appropriate reconciliation settings.


    ### Transaction Object Transformation


    Kashoo transactions arrive as JSON objects that require transformation into Odoo
    account.move records. The integration extracts the transaction date, reference
    number, and description for the move header. It then processes each line item
    to create account.move.line records with specific accounts and tax configurations.
    The system preserves the Kashoo transaction ID in a custom field for audit trail
    purposes.


    Transform Kashoo''s Canadian date format (YYYY-MM-DD) to Odoo''s date handling
    system. Convert amounts from Kashoo''s decimal strings to Odoo''s float precision
    numeric fields. Handle currency conversion for multi-currency transactions using
    the exchange rate embedded in the Kashoo transaction object. The system logs the
    original currency amount and exchange rate in the journal entry for reference.


    Process tax calculations with special attention to Canadian tax requirements.
    Extract GST/HST amounts from Kashoo line items and map them to the appropriate
    Odoo tax records. The integration must handle compound taxes where provincial
    sales tax calculates on the amount including federal GST. Preserve the complete
    tax breakdown in the journal entry description for audit purposes.


    ### Customer and Vendor Synchronization


    The integration matches Kashoo contact records with Odoo partners using email
    addresses and tax identification numbers. When Kashoo transactions reference customers
    or vendors that don''t exist in Odoo, the system creates new partner records automatically.
    It populates these records with available information from Kashoo, including billing
    addresses and payment terms.


    Handle Canadian business numbering system requirements by storing BN9 numbers
    in custom partner fields. The integration validates GST/HST registration numbers
    against Canadian government formats before creating partner records. It flags
    partners with invalid tax numbers for manual review by the accounting team. This
    validation prevents compliance issues during tax filing periods.


    Sync payment terms between systems by mapping Kashoo''s term codes to Odoo''s
    payment term objects. Common mappings include "NET15" to Odoo''s standard 15-day
    payment term and "NET30" to the 30-day equivalent. The integration applies these
    payment terms to newly created customer records, ensuring consistent payment tracking
    across both platforms.


    ## Error Handling and Resilience


    ### Common Sync Failures


    Authentication errors occur when Kashoo access tokens expire or become invalid.
    The integration detects these errors through HTTP 401 responses from Kashoo API
    calls. The system automatically attempts token refresh using the stored refresh
    token. If refresh fails, it notifies administrators and pauses synchronization
    until manual reauthentication occurs.


    Data validation errors happen when Kashoo transactions contain information that
    violates Odoo''s business rules. Common examples include invalid account codes,
    missing tax configurations, or date ranges outside open accounting periods. The
    integration captures these errors in the sync log and moves problematic transactions
    to a quarantine queue for manual resolution.


    Network timeouts and API rate limiting cause intermittent sync failures. The integration
    implements exponential backoff with jitter for these transient errors. It retries
    failed operations with increasing delays between attempts, up to a maximum of
    eight retries over twenty-four hours. This approach handles temporary service
    disruptions without overwhelming either API.


    ### Transaction Recovery Procedures


    The system maintains detailed sync logs that track every transaction processing
    attempt. Each log entry includes the Kashoo transaction ID, processing timestamp,
    success status, and error details if applicable. Administrators access these logs
    through a dedicated interface in Odoo''s Accounting module. The logs support filtering
    by date range, error type, and resolution status.


    Implement a retry mechanism for failed transactions that administrators trigger
    after resolving underlying issues. The system presents failed transactions with
    their error messages and suggested corrective actions. For validation errors,
    it often pre-fills the necessary configuration changes based on the specific error
    encountered. This guided resolution reduces the accounting team''s troubleshooting
    time.


    Handle duplicate transactions that result from webhook retries or manual intervention.
    The integration checks for existing transactions using the Kashoo transaction
    ID before creating new records. When duplicates occur, the system merges them
    by preserving the original record and updating it with any new information from
    the duplicate. This approach maintains data integrity while accommodating Kashoo''s
    at-least-once delivery guarantee.


    ### Disaster Recovery Planning


    Configure regular backups of the sync state metadata to enable recovery from catastrophic
    failures. The system exports the last successful sync timestamp, processed transaction
    counts, and configuration settings daily. Store these backups in secure cloud
    storage with version history enabled. Test the restoration process quarterly to
    ensure business continuity during major outages.


    Implement a manual sync override for situations where automated recovery fails.
    This feature allows administrators to specify a start date and force full resynchronization
    from that point forward. The system processes transactions in batches with progress
    tracking to prevent timeouts during large data transfers. Use this feature after
    extended outages or data corruption events.


    Establish alert thresholds that notify administrators of emerging problems before
    they cause widespread sync failures. Monitor metrics like sync success rate, average
    processing time, and queue depth. Configure alerts when these metrics deviate
    from baseline performance by more than twenty percent. Early detection enables
    proactive resolution before transactions backlog accumulates.


    ## Testing and Validation


    ### Integration Test Scenarios


    Create comprehensive test cases that cover all transaction types your business
    processes. Test sales transactions with various tax combinations including GST,
    HST, and PST. Verify that service revenue, product sales, and shipping charges
    all map correctly to their respective Odoo accounts. Test transactions with discounts
    to ensure proper amount calculations after discount application.


    Test expense transactions with employee reimbursements and vendor bills. Verify
    that GST input tax credits calculate correctly and map to the proper recoverable
    tax account. Test multi-currency transactions with exchange gains and losses to
    ensure proper financial reporting. Include edge cases like negative amounts (credits)
    and transactions with multiple tax rates on single line items.


    Validate bank transfers and reconciliation by creating Kashoo transactions that
    match Odoo bank statements. Test the automatic reconciliation feature that matches
    transactions based on amount, date, and reference number. Verify that unreconciled
    transactions appear in the proper reconciliation interface for manual resolution.
    Test partial payments and early payment discounts to ensure accurate accounting
    treatment.


    ### Data Integrity Verification


    Develop reconciliation reports that compare account balances between Kashoo and
    Odoo. Run these reports daily during the initial sync period and weekly thereafter.
    The reports should highlight discrepancies greater than configurable tolerance
    thresholds, typically one dollar for revenue accounts and zero for balance sheet
    accounts. Investigate and resolve any discrepancies immediately.


    Verify tax reporting accuracy by comparing GST/HST liability accounts between
    systems. The amounts should match exactly when considering the different reporting
    periods each system uses. Test filing-ready reports from both systems using the
    same date ranges to ensure consistent numbers. Pay special attention to GST on
    imports and reverse charge transactions that have unique accounting treatments.


    Validate customer and vendor balances by comparing aged receivables and payables
    reports. The totals should match within reasonable tolerances for timing differences
    in transaction posting. Investigate significant variances that indicate missing
    transactions or misapplied payments. Verify that payment terms and credit limits
    synchronize correctly for shared customer records.


    ### Performance Benchmarking


    Measure sync performance under various transaction volumes to establish performance
    baselines. Test with batches of 100, 1,000, and 10,000 transactions to identify
    scaling limitations. The system should process at least 500 transactions per minute
    on typical hardware configurations. Monitor system resources during sync operations
    to identify potential bottlenecks.


    Establish performance benchmarks for webhook processing to ensure real-time requirements
    meet business needs. The system should process webhook notifications within five
    seconds to prevent Kashoo retries. Test concurrent webhook handling to ensure
    multiple simultaneous transactions don''t create processing delays. Monitor API
    response times from both Kashoo and Odoo during peak usage periods.


    Validate data integrity after simulated network outages and service interruptions.
    Intentionally disrupt the sync process and verify that recovery procedures restore
    complete data consistency. Test the system''s ability to handle Kashoo API maintenance
    windows and Odoo module updates without data loss. Document any issues encountered
    and refine recovery procedures accordingly.


    ## Security Considerations


    ### Authentication Security


    Implement secure credential storage using Odoo''s encrypted fields for Kashoo
    client secrets and refresh tokens. Never store these values in plain text or in
    version-controlled configuration files. Rotate client secrets quarterly or following
    any security incident that might have compromised credential confidentiality.
    Use Odoo''s access rights system to restrict integration configuration to authorized
    personnel only.


    Enforce principle of least privilege when configuring Kashoo API permissions.
    Request only the scopes necessary for integration functionality, typically read-only
    access to financial data. Avoid administrative scopes unless absolutely required
    for your specific use case. Review API access logs regularly to detect unauthorized
    usage patterns or suspicious activity.


    Secure webhook endpoints with signature verification that validates each incoming
    request. Compute the expected signature using the webhook secret and compare it
    against the header value Kashoo provides. Reject any requests with invalid signatures
    or missing verification headers. Log verification failures for security monitoring
    and potential intrusion detection.


    ### Data Protection Measures


    Encrypt sensitive data in transit using TLS 1.2 or higher for all API communications.
    Configure Odoo to use modern cipher suites and disable outdated SSL protocols.
    Verify certificate validity for both Kashoo API endpoints and your Odoo instance.
    Use certificate pinning if your security policy requires protection against certificate
    authority compromises.


    Protect financial data at rest using Odoo''s database encryption capabilities
    or database-level encryption features. Encrypt fields containing bank account
    information, tax identification numbers, and other sensitive financial data. Implement
    access controls that restrict financial data access based on job responsibilities.
    Audit data access regularly to detect unauthorized viewing.


    Secure integration configuration interfaces with role-based access controls. Grant
    configuration access only to accounting managers and system administrators. Implement
    two-factor authentication for accounts with integration management privileges.
    Log all configuration changes with before-and-after values for audit trail purposes.


    ### Compliance Requirements


    Maintain compliance with Canadian privacy laws including PIPEDA for personal information
    protection. Anonymize or pseudonymize personal data where possible for testing
    and development environments. Implement data retention policies that automatically
    purge outdated transaction data according to statutory requirements. Document
    data handling procedures for regulatory inspection.


    Address GST/HST record-keeping requirements by preserving complete transaction
    details for six years. Ensure the integration captures all mandatory fields Canada
    Revenue Agency requires for audit purposes. Implement tamper-evident logging that
    detects unauthorized modification of historical financial records. Store audit
    logs in write-once-read-many storage for integrity protection.


    Follow payment card industry data security standards if processing credit card
    transactions through either system. Segment network architecture to isolate cardholder
    data environments from general business systems. Implement strict access controls
    and monitoring for any systems handling payment card information. Conduct regular
    security assessments to validate compliance.


    ## Performance Optimization


    ### Sync Process Optimization


    Implement parallel processing for independent transaction types to reduce sync
    duration. Process bank transactions, sales invoices, and vendor bills concurrently
    using Odoo''s queue job system. This approach utilizes available system resources
    more efficiently than sequential processing. Monitor system load to determine
    the optimal number of parallel workers for your hardware configuration.


    Optimize database queries by adding appropriate indexes on Kashoo transaction
    ID fields and sync timestamp columns. Analyze query performance using Odoo''s
    built-in query planning tools or database-specific performance monitors. Identify
    and optimize slow-running queries that impact sync performance during high-volume
    periods. Regular database maintenance including vacuum and analyze operations
    maintains optimal performance.


    Batch API calls to Kashoo to reduce connection overhead and improve throughput.
    Instead of fetching transactions individually, request pages of 100 transactions
    per API call. This approach reduces the total number of API requests and minimizes
    the impact of network latency. Implement intelligent prefetching that anticipates
    related data needs and retrieves them in single batched requests.


    ### Caching Strategies


    Cache static reference data like account mappings and tax configurations to avoid
    repeated database lookups. Store this data in Odoo''s cache with appropriate invalidation
    triggers when configuration changes occur. This optimization reduces database
    load during transaction processing and improves overall sync performance. Monitor
    cache hit ratios to ensure effective cache utilization.


    Implement response caching for Kashoo API calls that fetch rarely changing data.
    Cache company information, account lists, and tax rates with expiration times
    of twenty-four hours. This strategy reduces API call volume and improves resilience
    during Kashoo service interruptions. Include cache busting mechanisms that force
    refresh when configuration changes occur.


    Use Odoo''s distributed cache for multi-worker environments to maintain cache
    consistency across processes. Configure cache invalidation messages that notify
    all workers when reference data changes. This approach ensures all sync processes
    use the same cached data regardless of which worker processed the configuration
    update. Test cache synchronization during deployment to verify proper operation.


    ### Monitoring and Metrics


    Track key performance indicators that measure integration health and efficiency.
    Monitor average transaction processing time, sync success rate, and API response
    times. Set up dashboards that visualize these metrics with historical trends for
    capacity planning. Configure alerts when metrics deviate from established baselines
    by more than twenty percent.


    Implement detailed logging that captures performance data for individual sync
    operations. Log processing time per transaction, API call durations, and database
    query times. Analyze this data weekly to identify performance degradation patterns
    and optimization opportunities. Use statistical analysis to correlate performance
    metrics with system load and transaction volumes.


    Establish capacity planning procedures that project future performance based on
    business growth forecasts. Monitor transaction volume trends and extrapolate future
    system requirements. Plan hardware upgrades or architecture changes before performance
    bottlenecks impact business operations. Conduct load testing quarterly to validate
    capacity assumptions and identify emerging constraints.'
