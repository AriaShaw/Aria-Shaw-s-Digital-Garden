    customer lists, inventory, invoices, and financial data.
  intent_type: practitioner
  page_slug: migrate-from-excel-to-odoo
static_data:
  source_system: Excel Spreadsheets
  target_system: Odoo 18
  migration_complexity: Low to Medium
  excel_specific:
    common_use_cases:
    - Customer/vendor contact lists
    - Product inventory tracking
    - Sales pipeline spreadsheets
    - Manual invoicing records
    - Expense tracking
    preparation_steps:
    - step: Clean Your Excel Data
      tasks:
      - Remove duplicate rows
      - Standardize date formats (YYYY-MM-DD)
      - Ensure consistent column headers
      - Remove special characters from IDs
    - step: Map Excel Columns to Odoo Fields
      example: 'Excel Column       → Odoo Field

        Customer Name      → name

        Email Address      → email

        Phone Number       → phone

        Street Address     → street

        City               → city

        State/Province     → state_id (must match Odoo state code)

        ZIP/Postal Code    → zip

        Country            → country_id (must match Odoo country code)

        '
    - step: Download Odoo Import Template
      instructions:
      - Go to Odoo > Contacts (or any module)
      - Click Import button
      - Download the CSV template
      - Use template headers in your Excel file
    - step: Convert Excel to CSV
      method: Save As > CSV (Comma delimited)
      encoding: UTF-8 (important for special characters)
  import_examples:
    customers:
      excel_columns:
      - Company Name
      - Contact Person
      - Email
      - Phone
      odoo_import_file: res_partner_customers.csv
      odoo_fields:
      - name
      - contact_name
      - email
      - phone
    products:
      excel_columns:
      - SKU
      - Product Name
      - Unit Price
      - Stock Qty
      odoo_import_file: product_product.csv
      odoo_fields:
      - default_code
      - name
      - list_price
      - qty_available
    invoices:
      complexity: Medium - requires multiple related imports
      steps:
      - Import customers first (res.partner)
      - Import products (product.product)
      - Import invoices (account.move)
      - Import invoice lines (account.move.line)
  common_challenges:
  - challenge: Excel date format not recognized
    solution: 'Use YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g., 2025-01-15) or use Excel formula: =TEXT(A1,
      ''YYYY-MM-DD'')'
  - challenge: Duplicate customer names
    solution: Add unique identifier column (e.g., customer_id) or use 'Update existing
      records' option
  - challenge: State/Country codes mismatch
    solution: Download Odoo's country/state list, use VLOOKUP to map full names to
      codes
  - challenge: Large Excel files (10K+ rows)
    solution: Split into smaller CSV files (1000 rows each), import in batches
  step_by_step_example:
    scenario: Import 500 customers from Excel to Odoo
    steps:
    - step: 1
      action: Open Excel file, clean data
      command: Remove empty rows, fix phone formats
    - step: 2
      action: Add Odoo-required columns
      columns:
      - customer_rank (set to 1)
      - company_type (individual or company)
    - step: 3
      action: Save as CSV UTF-8
      file: customers_import.csv
    - step: 4
      action: Go to Odoo Contacts app
      click: Import button (top-right)
    - step: 5
      action: Upload CSV file
      settings: Select 'Create new records' or 'Update existing'
    - step: 6
      action: Map columns
      tip: Odoo auto-detects most column names if they match template
    - step: 7
      action: Test import
      validation: Import first 10 rows, check for errors
    - step: 8
      action: Full import
      monitor: Check import log for errors
  odoo_import_tips:
  - Use External ID for future updates (prevents duplicates)
  - Import master data first (customers, products) before transactions
  - Enable Developer Mode to see technical field names
  - Use Odoo's import history to rollback if needed
  estimated_time:
    small_dataset: 1-2 hours (< 1000 rows)
    medium_dataset: 4-8 hours (1000-10000 rows)
    large_dataset: 2-5 days (10000+ rows with complex relationships)

  introduction: 'Migrate from Excel to Odoo 18: SMB Data Import Guide 2025 requires
    specific technical decisions at every layer—operating system selection, PostgreSQL
    version and configuration, Python environment setup, NGINX reverse proxy implementation,
    SSL certificate management, and systemd service orchestration. This guide makes
    those decisions explicit, explaining the reasoning behind each configuration choice
    and the production implications of alternatives you might encounter.


    This guide eliminates the guesswork that plagues most cloud deployments. You won''t
    find vague recommendations to ''choose an appropriate instance size'' here. Every
    configuration parameter includes the specific value, the technical rationale,
    and the production failure mode it prevents.'

  conclusion: 'You achieved practical digital sovereignty by deploying Migrate from
    Excel to Odoo 18: SMB Data Import Guide 2025 on infrastructure you control at
    {{ cost_estimate.monthly_total }} monthly. This system eliminates dependency on
    managed Odoo hosting providers who lock you into proprietary platforms, restrict
    customization freedom, and increase prices arbitrarily because they control your
    data and operational access. You own your Odoo instance, your PostgreSQL database,
    your backup strategy, and your ability to migrate to different infrastructure
    providers if business requirements or pricing changes.


    The sovereignty advantage compounds over time. Your Odoo data exports to standard
    PostgreSQL dump files that restore on any compatible infrastructure—{{ provider_name
    }}, competing cloud providers, or on-premises hardware. Your configuration exists
    in documented scripts and files you can version control and replicate. Your operational
    knowledge transfers across infrastructure platforms because you understand the
    underlying components rather than provider-specific management interfaces. This
    portability and knowledge ownership protect against vendor lock-in and preserve
    your ability to optimize costs as your business evolves.


    Maintain this sovereignty by documenting your deployment, testing your backups
    quarterly, and staying current with security updates. The infrastructure you built
    today serves business needs for years while remaining under your control—that
    combination of longevity, ownership, and cost efficiency justifies the deployment
    effort and establishes the operational foundation your business deserves.

    headline: Complete Your Digital Sovereignty Stack
    body: 'You deployed Migrate from Excel to Odoo 18: SMB Data Import Guide 2025
      infrastructure for {{ cost_estimate.monthly_total }} monthly—sixty percent less
      than managed hosting. But infrastructure alone doesn''t deliver digital sovereignty.
      You need backup automation, disaster recovery procedures, migration tooling,
      performance optimization, and operational runbooks.


      The **Odoo Digital Sovereignty Master Pack** combines all five modules into
      a complete operational toolkit: Strategic Command for TCO analysis and roadmap
      planning, Technical Architecture for server selection and configuration, Data
      Migration for risk-free transitions, Fortress Protection for backup automation
      and disaster recovery, and Operations Console for monitoring and performance
      tuning.
