      - Import invoice lines (account.move.line)
  common_challenges:
  - challenge: Excel date format not recognized
    solution: 'Use YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g., 2025-01-15) or use Excel formula: =TEXT(A1,
      ''YYYY-MM-DD'')'
  - challenge: Duplicate customer names
    solution: Add unique identifier column (e.g., customer_id) or use 'Update existing
      records' option
  - challenge: State/Country codes mismatch
    solution: Download Odoo's country/state list, use VLOOKUP to map full names to
      codes
  - challenge: Large Excel files (10K+ rows)
    solution: Split into smaller CSV files (1000 rows each), import in batches
  step_by_step_example:
    scenario: Import 500 customers from Excel to Odoo
    steps:
    - step: 1
      action: Open Excel file, clean data
      command: Remove empty rows, fix phone formats
    - step: 2
      action: Add Odoo-required columns
      columns:
      - customer_rank (set to 1)
      - company_type (individual or company)
    - step: 3

  introduction: 'Migrate from Excel to Odoo 18: SMB Data Import Guide 2025 addresses
    the highest-risk operation in ERP implementations: moving years of transactional
    history, customer relationships, and operational data from Excel Spreadsheets
    to Odoo without corruption, loss, or business disruption. Unlike fresh Odoo deployments
    where you start with clean databases and establish new workflows, migration carries
    the weight of existing business commitments—open sales orders, pending invoices,
    inventory obligations, and customer payment histories that must transfer intact
    or cause immediate operational failures.


    The risk profile differs fundamentally from typical software projects. When you
    deploy new infrastructure or upgrade between Odoo versions, failures delay timelines
    but rarely corrupt existing data. Migration failures destroy information. A misconfigured
    field mapping overwrites customer credit limits. An incorrect date format converts
    two years of transaction timestamps to invalid values. A skipped validation step
    imports duplicate records that corrupt financial reports for months before anyone
    notices the discrepancy. These aren''t hypothetical scenarios—they''re documented
    migration failures that cost businesses tens of thousands in recovery efforts
    and lost customer trust.


    This guide implements Migrate from Excel to Odoo 18: SMB Data Import Guide 2025
    using a four-phase methodology that prioritizes data validation over speed, reversibility
    over convenience, and parallel operation over risky cutover events. You will extract
    complete datasets from Excel Spreadsheets, map fields to Odoo''s schema with validation
    rules that catch format mismatches before import, test migration procedures against
    staging environments that mirror production data volumes, and execute the final
    cutover with rollback procedures that restore Excel Spreadsheets if critical issues
    emerge. The complete migration timeline runs 4-6 weeks, but delivers operational
    Odoo systems with verified data integrity rather than corrupted databases that
    require expensive forensic recovery.

    '
  conclusion: 'You achieved practical digital sovereignty by deploying Migrate from
    Excel to Odoo 18: SMB Data Import Guide 2025 on infrastructure you control at
    $50-100 monthly. This system eliminates dependency on managed Odoo hosting providers
    who lock you into proprietary platforms, restrict customization freedom, and increase
    prices arbitrarily because they control your data and operational access. You
    own your Odoo instance, your PostgreSQL database, your backup strategy, and your
    ability to migrate to different infrastructure providers if business requirements
    or pricing changes.


    The sovereignty advantage compounds over time. Your Odoo data exports to standard
    PostgreSQL dump files that restore on any compatible infrastructure—your cloud
    provider, competing cloud providers, or on-premises hardware. Your configuration
    exists in documented scripts and files you can version control and replicate.
    Your operational knowledge transfers across infrastructure platforms because you
    understand the underlying components rather than provider-specific management
    interfaces. This portability and knowledge ownership protect against vendor lock-in
    and preserve your ability to optimize costs as your business evolves.


    Maintain this sovereignty by documenting your deployment, testing your backups
    quarterly, and staying current with security updates. The infrastructure you built
    today serves business needs for years while remaining under your control—that
    combination of longevity, ownership, and cost efficiency justifies the deployment
    effort and establishes the operational foundation your business deserves.

  troubleshooting_guide: '## Common Issues and Solutions


    **Issue: Odoo service fails to start after installation**


    Check the service status and logs to identify the specific error. Run `systemctl
    status odoo` to see if systemd reports configuration file errors, permission problems,
    or missing dependencies. Most startup failures trace to incorrect paths in the
    configuration file—verify `/etc/odoo/odoo.conf` contains valid paths to the Odoo
    installation directory, addons folders, and log file location. Migration-specific
    startup failures often involve database schema incompatibilities. Check Odoo logs
    for "column does not exist" or "relation does not exist" errors—these indicate
    incomplete migration or incompatible module versions. Verify all custom modules
    are compatible with the target Odoo version. Disable custom modules temporarily
    to isolate whether they cause startup failures.


    **Issue: Database connection errors**


    Odoo cannot connect to PostgreSQL, typically showing "FATAL: password authentication
    failed" or "could not connect to server" errors. Verify PostgreSQL is running
    with `systemctl status postgresql`, confirm the Odoo database user exists with
    correct credentials, and check `pg_hba.conf` allows local connections. The Odoo
    configuration file''s `db_user`, `db_password`, and `db_host` parameters must
    match your PostgreSQL setup exactly—case sensitivity matters for usernames.


    **Issue: Port 8069 not accessible from browser**


    The firewall blocks incoming connections to Odoo''s default port. During migration,
    you may run both old and new Odoo instances simultaneously. Configure the new
    instance on a different port (e.g., 8070) to avoid conflicts, then update firewall
    rules to allow both ports during the parallel running period. After cutover completes,
    remove the old instance''s port from firewall rules. For production deployments
    behind NGINX reverse proxy, you should block external port 8069 access entirely
    and only expose ports 80/443, which NGINX proxies to Odoo''s localhost:8069.


    **Issue: Module installation fails with dependency errors**


    Odoo modules declare dependencies on other modules, and installation fails if
    dependencies are missing or if circular dependencies exist. Read the error message
    carefully—it specifies which module dependency is missing. Install missing modules
    through the Apps menu first, then retry the original module installation. For
    custom modules, verify the `__manifest__.py` file declares all dependencies in
    the `depends` list.


    **Issue: PDF generation produces blank or malformed documents**


    Migrated report templates may use deprecated QWeb syntax or reference removed
    fields. Test all report types (invoices, delivery orders, purchase orders) immediately
    after migration. Broken reports show XML parsing errors in logs. Recreate problematic
    reports using Odoo''s Studio or fix the QWeb templates in custom modules. Standard
    Odoo reports rarely break—issues typically come from customized templates.


    **Issue: Performance degradation with increasing users**


    Post-migration performance issues often trace to missing database indexes or outdated
    statistics. Run `REINDEX DATABASE` on your Odoo database after large data imports:
    `psql -d odoo_db -c ''REINDEX DATABASE odoo_db''`. Update PostgreSQL statistics
    with `VACUUM ANALYZE` to help the query planner choose efficient execution paths.
    Large migrations benefit from temporarily increasing PostgreSQL''s `maintenance_work_mem`
    for faster index building.


    **Issue: Backup or restore operations fail**


    Backup both source and target systems before cutover. Create a backup of the old
    system immediately before final data export, and backup the new Odoo instance
    after import but before user access begins. Store backups off-server—migration
    failures sometimes corrupt local storage. Verify backups are restorable by testing
    restoration on a separate server.


    **Issue: SSL certificate errors or mixed content warnings**


    Migrated systems may have hardcoded URLs in database records pointing to the old
    system. Search for old domain references in `ir.config_parameter` system settings
    and update to the new domain. Use SQL queries to find hardcoded URLs: `SELECT
    * FROM ir_attachment WHERE url LIKE ''%olddomain.com%''`. Update attachment URLs
    and regenerate reports that embed URLs.

  migration_guide: 'Migrating from Excel Spreadsheets to Odoo 18 requires production
    infrastructure ready before you begin data extraction and transformation activities.
    Attempting to export data, build import scripts, and configure the target system
    simultaneously guarantees timeline delays and increases the risk of errors that
    corrupt production data or require complete restarts.


    The migration follows a structured four-phase workflow that balances speed with
    risk mitigation. Phase one focuses on dependency mapping and data extraction.
    Phase two establishes the Odoo environment with equivalent functionality. Phase
    three handles data transformation and import validation. Phase four manages cutover
    procedures and parallel running verification.


    ## Phase 1: Preparation and Data Extraction (Week 1-2)


    QuickBooks Desktop and QuickBooks Online use different export procedures. Desktop
    versions export data through built-in utilities (Company > Export > Lists to IIF
    Files) or third-party tools like Transaction Pro Exporter. QuickBooks Online provides
    CSV export through Reports interface—run each report type (Customer List, Product/Service
    List, Sales by Customer, etc.) and export to CSV. For comprehensive exports, QuickBooks
    API access through applications like SaaSant Transactions or Able2Extract provides
    more complete data extraction.


    Document every Excel Spreadsheets feature your team currently uses because each
    one represents a capability you''ll need to replicate or replace in Odoo. QuickBooks''s
    job costing becomes Odoo''s Project module with analytic accounts. QuickBooks
    classes for department/location tracking map to Odoo''s analytic tags or dimensions.
    QuickBooks memorized transactions become Odoo''s recurring entries. QuickBooks
    price levels translate to Odoo''s pricelist system with customer-specific or quantity-based
    pricing.


    Export your complete dataset including master data (customers, products, vendors)
    and transactional history (sales orders, invoices, payments). Most migrations
    import 2-3 years of historical transactions for reporting continuity—older data
    can remain archived in Excel Spreadsheets for reference without loading into Odoo''s
    active database.


    ## Phase 2: Odoo Environment Setup (Week 2-3)


    Deploy Odoo 18 on production-grade infrastructure before attempting any data imports.
    The deployment guide earlier in this document establishes the technical foundation—PostgreSQL
    database, application server, backup systems, monitoring tools. Complete the entire
    deployment and verify system stability before proceeding to data import activities.


    Install the Odoo modules that match your Excel Spreadsheets functionality:


    - Accounting module replaces QuickBooks''s financial core (chart of accounts,
    journal entries, reconciliation)

    - Sales module handles quotes, sales orders, and invoicing

    - Purchase module manages vendor bills and purchase orders

    - Inventory module tracks stock movements and valuations

    - Project module provides job costing and time tracking


    Configure each module''s settings to match your business processes. Payment terms,
    tax rates, fiscal year definitions, currency handling, warehouse locations—these
    configurations must exist before importing transactional data that references
    them. Missing configurations cause import failures with cryptic error messages
    about missing foreign key relationships.


    ## Phase 3: Data Transformation and Import (Week 3-6)


    Excel Spreadsheets-specific data structures don''t directly map to Odoo''s data
    model. QuickBooks''s "Items" serve multiple purposes (products, services, discounts,
    subtotals) that map to different Odoo objects. Physical products become product.product
    entries, services remain services, discount items become sale.order.line with
    negative amounts. QuickBooks sub-customers (jobs under main customer) require
    parent-child partner relationships in Odoo.


    The transformation process converts Excel Spreadsheets exports into Odoo-compatible
    CSV files or XML-RPC API calls. Start with master data in this specific order:


    1. **Chart of Accounts and Tax Definitions**: Financial configuration must exist
    before importing transactions that reference account codes and tax rates. Export
    Excel Spreadsheets''s chart of accounts, map to Odoo''s account.account structure,
    and import via CSV through Accounting module.


    2. **Customers and Vendors (Partners)**: Excel Spreadsheets''s customer and vendor
    records become res.partner entries in Odoo. Map contact information, billing/shipping
    addresses, payment terms, and credit limits. Handle QuickBooks stores multiple
    "Ship To" addresses per customer as separate address records. Map these to contact
    child records under the main res.partner entry in Odoo, using contact type "Delivery
    Address". Handle QuickBooks terms (Net 30, Due on Receipt) by mapping to Odoo''s
    payment.term model.


    3. **Products and Services**: Export product catalog from Excel Spreadsheets with
    SKUs, descriptions, pricing, and cost data. Map to Odoo''s product.product and
    product.template models, handling QuickBooks Items include inventory parts, non-inventory
    parts, and service items. Map inventory parts to stockable products in Odoo, non-inventory
    to consumable products, and services to service type products. QuickBooks''s two-sided
    items (both income and expense accounts) require careful mapping to Odoo''s product
    fiscal properties.


    4. **Transactional History**: Import sales orders, invoices, and payments chronologically
    starting from your cutoff date (typically 2-3 years prior). Export QuickBooks
    transactions chronologically to maintain proper historical sequence. Sales Orders
    become sale.order records, Invoices map to account.move (type ''out_invoice''),
    Bills to account.move (type ''in_invoice''). QuickBooks''s "Receive Payment" transactions
    create account.payment entries in Odoo. Handle partially paid invoices by creating
    payment records that allocate amounts across multiple invoices.


    Test imports extensively in a staging environment. Create a full copy of your
    production Odoo instance, import a small data subset (10-20 records per type),
    and verify all relationships and calculations work correctly. Fix mapping errors
    in your transformation scripts, then import progressively larger datasets until
    you''ve validated the complete process.


    ## Phase 4: Cutover and Parallel Running (Week 6-8)


    The migration cutover requires careful timing to minimize business disruption.
    Schedule go-live for a weekend or slow business period when you can afford several
    hours of downtime for final data synchronization and validation.


    Execute the cutover in this sequence:


    1. **Final Excel Spreadsheets backup**: Perform a complete backup of Excel Spreadsheets
    immediately before starting cutover procedures. This backup serves as your rollback
    point if critical issues emerge.


    2. **Delta synchronization**: Import all Excel Spreadsheets transactions created
    since your last test import. Your transformation scripts should handle incremental
    imports, updating existing records and creating new ones without duplication.


    3. **Data validation checks**: Run comprehensive validation queries comparing
    Excel Spreadsheets totals to Odoo totals. Customer count, product count, outstanding
    invoice balances, accounts receivable aging—these must match exactly. Discrepancies
    indicate import errors that require immediate correction.


    4. **User training and access provisioning**: Create Odoo user accounts for all
    staff members with appropriate security groups and access rights. Conduct brief
    training sessions covering navigation, transaction entry, and report generation
    for their specific roles.


    5. **Parallel running period**: Operate both Excel Spreadsheets and Odoo simultaneously
    for 1-2 weeks. Enter new transactions in Odoo while maintaining Excel Spreadsheets
    read-only access for reference. This parallel period builds confidence and identifies
    gaps in Odoo configuration or training.


    6. **Excel Spreadsheets decommissioning**: After successful parallel running validates
    Odoo handles all business operations correctly, decommission Excel Spreadsheets.
    Cancel any subscriptions, export final reports for archival, and establish read-only
    access for historical data queries.


    ## Common Migration Pitfalls and Solutions


    **Challenge**: QuickBooks''s complex chart of accounts with nested subaccounts.

    **Solution**: Flatten or simplify account structure during migration. QuickBooks
    allows unlimited nesting; Odoo handles one level of parent-child relationships
    naturally. Deeply nested accounts require rethinking your account organization.


    **Challenge**: QuickBooks Online''s API rate limits during large data exports.

    **Solution**: Export data in batches over several hours or days rather than attempting
    single bulk export. Use incremental sync tools that track last export timestamp
    and only pull new/modified records.


    **Underestimating data cleanup effort**: Excel Spreadsheets accumulates years
    of inconsistent data entry—duplicate customer records, products with incorrect
    categories, transactions with missing information. Plan to spend 30-40% of migration
    time cleaning source data before import. Bad data imported into Odoo multiplies
    cleanup effort tenfold.


    **Inadequate testing of edge cases**: Your transformation scripts handle common
    scenarios correctly but fail on edge cases like products without SKUs, customers
    with only shipping addresses (no billing), or voided invoices. Test your import
    process with the full dataset, not samples, to expose these issues before go-live.


    **Insufficient user training**: Power users with years of Excel Spreadsheets experience
    struggle with Odoo''s different workflows and terminology. Budget for comprehensive
    training and provide job aids documenting common tasks in Odoo terms. Plan for
    productivity dips during the first 2-4 weeks post-migration.


    **Missing validation procedures**: Without systematic validation, you discover
    missing data or incorrect mappings weeks after go-live when reconstruction becomes
    impossible. Create validation checklists comparing Excel Spreadsheets reports
    to Odoo equivalents: customer aging reports, inventory valuation, profit & loss
    statements.
