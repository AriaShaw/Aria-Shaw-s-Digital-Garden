  main_content: "## Integration Architecture and Data Flow\n\n### Core Integration\
    \ Components\n\nThe Stripe-Odoo integration employs a bidirectional architecture\
    \ with three primary components. Odoo 18 serves as the central business operations\
    \ hub, managing customers, products, and accounting. Stripe handles payment processing\
    \ with its secure gateway and fraud detection systems. The connection layer uses\
    \ webhooks for real-time notifications and API calls for data retrieval.\n\nOdoo's\
    \ payment provider framework extends through custom module development. You create\
    \ a new payment acquirer that implements Stripe's Checkout API. This approach\
    \ maintains Odoo's native payment workflow while integrating Stripe's advanced\
    \ features. The module handles payment initialization through controller endpoints\
    \ that redirect customers to Stripe-hosted checkout pages.\n\n### Data Flow Patterns\n\
    \nPayment initialization starts when a customer selects Stripe during Odoo checkout.\
    \ Odoo generates a unique session ID and creates a pending sale order. The system\
    \ redirects the customer to Stripe's hosted checkout page with product details\
    \ and total amount. Stripe processes the payment and captures the transaction\
    \ through its payment processor network.\n\nWebhooks deliver real-time payment\
    \ events to your Odoo instance. Stripe sends HTTPS POST requests to your designated\
    \ webhook endpoint for each payment state change. Your integration code processes\
    \ these events and updates Odoo records accordingly. Successful payments trigger\
    \ order confirmation and inventory reservation.\n\n### Synchronization Mechanisms\n\
    \nThe integration implements idempotent webhook handling to prevent duplicate\
    \ processing. Each Stripe event contains a unique identifier that your system\
    \ tracks. Before processing any webhook, Odoo checks its event log for previous\
    \ instances. This design ensures reliable operation even with duplicate webhook\
    \ deliveries.\n\nScheduled jobs handle data reconciliation between the systems.\
    \ A daily cron job fetches recent Stripe transactions that might have missed webhook\
    \ notifications. Another job synchronizes customer data from Odoo to Stripe for\
    \ recurring billing scenarios. These mechanisms provide backup synchronization\
    \ beyond the real-time webhook system.\n\n### Architecture Considerations\n\n\
    Design your integration with webhook failure scenarios in mind. Implement retry\
    \ logic with exponential backoff for temporary Odoo outages. Store webhook payloads\
    \ in a queue system for asynchronous processing during peak loads. This approach\
    \ maintains system reliability even under adverse conditions.\n\nConsider multi-company\
    \ configurations if your Odoo instance serves multiple businesses. Each company\
    \ requires separate Stripe account configuration with independent webhook endpoints.\
    \ The payment acquirer module must route transactions to the correct Stripe account\
    \ based on the current company context. Proper isolation ensures financial data\
    \ separation between business entities.\n\n## Step-by-Step Configuration\n\n###\
    \ Stripe Account Preparation\n\nBegin with Stripe account configuration for Odoo\
    \ integration. Log into your Stripe dashboard and navigate to the Developers section.\
    \ Create a new restricted key with specific permissions for payments and webhooks.\
    \ Enable the \"Read and write\" scope for charges, payment intents, and customers.\
    \ Generate a new webhook signing secret for endpoint verification.\n\nConfigure\
    \ your Stripe webhook endpoint to point to your Odoo instance. Use the format\
    \ https://your-odoo-domain.com/stripe/webhook for the endpoint URL. Select these\
    \ essential events: payment_intent.succeeded, payment_intent.payment_failed, charge.refunded,\
    \ and customer.subscription.updated. Stripe will send test events to validate\
    \ your endpoint connectivity.\n\n### Odoo Module Development\n\nCreate a new custom\
    \ Odoo module for Stripe integration. Define the module manifest with dependencies\
    \ on payment, sale, and account modules. Create a new Python file for your payment\
    \ acquirer model that extends PaymentProvider. Implement the required methods\
    \ for payment processing and status handling.\n\nConfigure the payment acquirer\
    \ form with Stripe-specific fields. Add configuration fields for publishable key,\
    \ secret key, and webhook secret. Implement proper credential storage using Odoo's\
    \ encrypted fields for sensitive data. Create user interface elements that guide\
    \ administrators through the setup process.\n\n```python\nclass PaymentStripe(models.Model):\n\
    \    _inherit = 'payment.provider'\n\n    code = fields.Char(default='stripe')\n\
    \    stripe_publishable_key = fields.Char(string='Publishable Key', required=True)\n\
    \    stripe_secret_key = fields.Char(string='Secret Key', required=True)\n   \
    \ stripe_webhook_secret = fields.Char(string='Webhook Secret', required=True)\n\
    \n    def _get_supported_currencies(self):\n        return ['USD', 'EUR', 'GBP',\
    \ 'CAD']\n```\n\n### Controller Implementation\n\nDevelop web controllers that\
    \ handle the payment flow. Create a payment initiation endpoint that creates Stripe\
    \ Checkout Sessions. Implement a return controller that processes customers after\
    \ Stripe checkout completion. Build the webhook endpoint that receives and verifies\
    \ Stripe event notifications.\n\nThe webhook controller must verify request signatures\
    \ using your webhook secret. Implement signature validation before processing\
    \ any webhook payload. Parse the JSON event data and route to appropriate handlers\
    \ based on event type. Maintain an event log to prevent duplicate processing.\n\
    \n```python\n@http.route('/stripe/webhook', type='json', auth='public', methods=['POST'],\
    \ csrf=False)\ndef stripe_webhook(self):\n    payload = request.httprequest.data\n\
    \    sig_header = request.httprequest.headers.get('Stripe-Signature')\n    \n\
    \    try:\n        event = stripe.Webhook.construct_event(\n            payload,\
    \ sig_header, self.stripe_webhook_secret\n        )\n    except ValueError as\
    \ e:\n        raise e\n    except stripe.error.SignatureVerificationError as e:\n\
    \        raise e\n        \n    self.process_stripe_event(event)\n    return json.dumps({'status':\
    \ 'success'})\n```\n\n### Payment Flow Configuration\n\nConfigure Odoo's payment\
    \ system to recognize your Stripe integration. Enable the Stripe payment acquirer\
    \ in your Odoo accounting settings. Set transaction fees and currency support\
    \ according to your business requirements. Test the payment flow in Stripe's test\
    \ mode before going live.\n\nImplement customer redirection to Stripe Checkout\
    \ during payment processing. Generate unique session IDs that link Stripe payments\
    \ to Odoo sales orders. Handle successful payments by verifying payment intent\
    \ status before confirming orders. Manage failed payments with clear error messages\
    \ and retry options.\n\n### Webhook Security Setup\n\nStrengthen webhook security\
    \ with additional verification measures. Implement IP whitelisting for Stripe's\
    \ webhook IP ranges. Add timestamp validation to reject old webhook events. Create\
    \ a webhook event monitoring system that alerts on processing failures. Test webhook\
    \ reliability with Stripe's CLI tool before production deployment.\n\nConfigure\
    \ webhook retry settings in your Stripe dashboard. Set reasonable retry intervals\
    \ that match your system's processing capacity. Monitor webhook success rates\
    \ through Stripe's dashboard metrics. Establish alerting for elevated webhook\
    \ failure rates that might indicate system issues.\n\n### Common Configuration\
    \ Pitfalls\n\nAvoid these common mistakes during Stripe-Odoo configuration. Never\
    \ use test mode keys in production environments, which causes payment processing\
    \ failures. Ensure webhook endpoints use HTTPS in production for secure communication.\
    \ Verify currency configuration matches between Stripe and Odoo to prevent conversion\
    \ errors.\n\nTest webhook connectivity from Stripe's dashboard before processing\
    \ live payments. Validate that all required event types are enabled for proper\
    \ order synchronization. Confirm that your Odoo server clock synchronizes with\
    \ NTP to prevent timestamp validation issues. Check that firewall rules permit\
    \ inbound webhook connections from Stripe's IP ranges.\n\n## Data Mapping and\
    \ Transformation\n\n### Customer Data Synchronization\n\nStripe and Odoo maintain\
    \ separate customer records that require careful mapping. Odoo's res.partner model\
    \ contains comprehensive customer data while Stripe's Customer objects focus on\
    \ payment information. Create bidirectional synchronization that preserves data\
    \ integrity across both systems.\n\nWhen a new customer completes a Stripe payment,\
    \ Odoo creates a partner record from available information. Map Stripe's customer\
    \ email to Odoo's partner email field. Use the customer name field for the partner\
    \ name. Store the Stripe customer ID in a custom field on the partner record for\
    \ future reference.\n\nFor existing Odoo customers making first-time Stripe payments,\
    \ create Stripe Customer objects. Send partner name, email, and address information\
    \ to Stripe during customer creation. Store the returned Stripe customer ID in\
    \ Odoo for subsequent transactions. This approach enables Stripe's customer portal\
    \ features and subscription management.\n\n### Product and Price Alignment\n\n\
    Maintain consistent product information between Odoo's product catalog and Stripe's\
    \ Product API. Odoo products contain detailed inventory and accounting data while\
    \ Stripe products focus on payment presentation. Implement transformation logic\
    \ that syncs essential product attributes.\n\nMap Odoo product names to Stripe\
    \ product names during checkout session creation. Use Odoo product descriptions\
    \ for Stripe's product metadata. Sync product images from Odoo to Stripe for consistent\
    \ customer experience. Ensure price accuracy by converting Odoo product prices\
    \ to Stripe's currency format.\n\n### Transaction Data Mapping\n\nPayment transactions\
    \ require precise mapping between Stripe charges and Odoo account moves. Stripe's\
    \ PaymentIntent objects contain detailed payment method information while Odoo's\
    \ account.move records track accounting entries. Create transformation logic that\
    \ converts Stripe data into proper journal items.\n\nMap Stripe charge amounts\
    \ to Odoo journal entry amounts, accounting for currency conversion. Transform\
    \ Stripe fee structures into separate journal items for proper expense tracking.\
    \ Convert Stripe's payment method types to Odoo's payment method classifications.\
    \ Handle refund transactions by creating credit journal entries linked to original\
    \ invoices.\n\n### Subscription Billing Integration\n\nRecurring billing scenarios\
    \ require complex mapping between Stripe subscriptions and Odoo contracts. Stripe's\
    \ subscription objects manage billing cycles and invoice generation while Odoo's\
    \ sale.subscription model tracks contract states. Implement synchronization that\
    \ maintains consistency across both systems.\n\nTransform Stripe subscription\
    \ items to Odoo subscription lines with proper product mapping. Convert Stripe\
    \ billing cycle anchors to Odoo's invoice scheduling system. Map Stripe subscription\
    \ status to Odoo contract states for accurate reporting. Handle subscription updates\
    \ by modifying Odoo contracts and regenerating invoice schedules.\n\n### Address\
    \ and Tax Handling\n\nCustomer address data requires special handling for tax\
    \ calculation and compliance. Stripe collects minimal address information for\
    \ payment processing while Odoo maintains detailed partner addresses. Implement\
    \ transformation that enriches Stripe address data with Odoo's comprehensive records.\n\
    \nMap Stripe's address fields to Odoo's partner address structure during customer\
    \ creation. Use Odoo's tax calculation engine to determine proper tax rates based\
    \ on customer location. Transform Stripe tax ID information into Odoo's partner\
    \ tax fields for invoice compliance. Handle address updates by synchronizing changes\
    \ between both systems.\n\n### Custom Field Extensions\n\nMany businesses require\
    \ custom field mapping beyond standard data models. Extend both Odoo and Stripe\
    \ objects with custom fields for business-specific data. Implement transformation\
    \ logic that preserves custom data during synchronization.\n\nAdd custom fields\
    \ to Odoo's partner model for Stripe-specific attributes like payment method preferences.\
    \ Extend Stripe's metadata fields with Odoo internal identifiers for better traceability.\
    \ Create mapping rules that transform custom business data between the different\
    \ field structures. Document all custom field mappings for maintenance purposes.\n\
    \n## Error Handling and Resilience \n\n### Webhook Failure Scenarios\n\
    \nWebhook delivery failures represent the most common integration challenge. Stripe's\
    \ webhook system retries failed deliveries, but your integration must handle duplicates\
    \ and out-of-order events. Implement idempotent processing that checks for existing\
    \ events before taking action.\n\nCreate an event tracking system that records\
    \ all processed webhook IDs. Before processing any webhook, query this tracking\
    \ system for existing records. Log duplicate events for monitoring without executing\
    \ business logic. Design your event handlers to process events in any sequence\
    \ without data corruption.\n\n### Payment Dispute Management\n\nStripe payment\
    \ disputes require immediate attention and specific handling in Odoo. When Stripe\
    \ sends a dispute webhook, your integration must freeze related orders and notify\
    \ appropriate teams. Implement dispute workflow that coordinates between finance\
    \ and customer service departments.\n\nMap Stripe dispute statuses to Odoo's internal\
    \ dispute tracking system. Create automated actions that place disputed orders\
    \ on hold pending resolution. Generate dispute response tasks for customer service\
    \ teams with relevant transaction details. Sync dispute outcomes between systems\
    \ to maintain accurate financial records.\n\n### API Rate Limiting\n\nBoth Stripe\
    \ and Odoo enforce API rate limits that can impact integration performance. Stripe's\
    \ rate limits vary by endpoint and account volume while Odoo's limits depend on\
    \ server configuration. Implement smart throttling that respects both systems'\
    \ limitations.\n\nAdd exponential backoff retry logic for rate limit responses\
    \ from either API. Queue non-critical operations during peak usage periods to\
    \ avoid limit violations. Monitor API usage metrics to identify patterns that\
    \ trigger rate limiting. Implement circuit breaker patterns that fail gracefully\
    \ during extended API outages.\n\n### Data Validation Errors\n\nData mismatches\
    \ between systems cause validation failures during synchronization. Common issues\
    \ include currency mismatches, missing required fields, and invalid reference\
    \ IDs. Implement comprehensive validation that catches errors before processing.\n\
    \nValidate currency codes match between Stripe transactions and Odoo journals\
    \ before creating accounting entries. Check for required customer fields before\
    \ creating Odoo partner records. Verify product existence in Odoo before processing\
    \ subscription line items. Log validation errors with sufficient context for troubleshooting.\n\
    \n### Reconciliation Procedures\n\nDespite robust integration, occasional manual\
    \ reconciliation becomes necessary. Develop standardized procedures for identifying\
    \ and resolving synchronization gaps. Create reconciliation reports that highlight\
    \ discrepancies between Stripe and Odoo data.\n\nBuild automated reconciliation\
    \ tools that compare Stripe balance transactions with Odoo accounting entries.\
    \ Generate exception reports for transactions that exist in one system but not\
    \ the other. Create manual correction workflows for finance teams to resolve discrepancies.\
    \ Document common reconciliation scenarios and their resolution procedures.\n\n\
    ## Testing and Validation\n\n### Test Environment Configuration\n\nEstablish dedicated\
    \ test environments for Stripe-Odoo integration validation. Create separate Stripe\
    \ test accounts with test mode API keys. Configure a staging Odoo instance with\
    \ sample data that mirrors production. Use Stripe's test card numbers for payment\
    \ simulation without actual charges.\n\nImplement webhook testing with Stripe's\
    \ CLI tool for local development. Forward webhooks to your development environment\
    \ for real-time testing. Create test data factories that generate realistic orders\
    \ and customer records. Automate environment setup for consistent testing across\
    \ team members.\n\n### Payment Flow Test Scenarios\n\nDesign comprehensive test\
    \ cases that cover all payment flow variations. Test successful payments with\
    \ various card types and currencies. Simulate failed payments due to insufficient\
    \ funds and card declines. Validate partial refunds and full refunds processing\
    \ through both systems.\n\nTest subscription scenarios with trial periods and\
    \ price changes. Validate webhook handling for subscription lifecycle events.\
    \ Verify failed payment recovery for subscription billing. Test customer portal\
    \ functionality for subscription management.\n\n### Webhook Reliability Testing\n\
    \nVerify webhook processing reliability under various conditions. Test duplicate\
    \ webhook delivery handling by sending identical events multiple times. Simulate\
    \ out-of-order event processing by delaying specific webhooks. Verify system behavior\
    \ when webhooks arrive for non-existent resources.\n\nTest webhook signature validation\
    \ by modifying payloads and verifying rejection. Simulate slow processing by adding\
    \ delays to webhook handlers. Verify queueing mechanisms handle webhook bursts\
    \ without data loss. Test recovery procedures after extended webhook delivery\
    \ failures.\n\n### Data Synchronization Validation\n\nCreate validation scripts\
    \ that verify data consistency between Stripe and Odoo. Compare customer records\
    \ between systems and flag discrepancies. Validate transaction amounts and dates\
    \ match across accounting entries. Verify product and pricing information remains\
    \ synchronized.\n\nImplement automated synchronization checks that run as scheduled\
    \ jobs. Generate data quality reports that highlight synchronization issues. Create\
    \ alerting for data drift beyond acceptable thresholds. Document data correction\
    \ procedures for identified discrepancies.\n\n### Performance and Load Testing\n\
    \nAssess integration performance under expected production loads. Simulate peak\
    \ sales periods with concurrent payment processing. Measure webhook processing\
    \ latency during high-volume events. Test API rate limit handling and graceful\
    \ degradation.\n\nEstablish performance benchmarks for key integration operations.\
    \ Monitor system resource usage during load testing to identify bottlenecks. Verify\
    \ integration scalability through gradual load increase. Document performance\
    \ characteristics for capacity planning.\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n###\
    \ PCI Compliance Requirements\n\nStripe integration reduces PCI compliance scope\
    \ but introduces specific security obligations. Stripe handles sensitive card\
    \ data through its hosted checkout pages, but your integration must protect API\
    \ keys and webhook endpoints. Implement key management that separates test and\
    \ production credentials.\n\nStore Stripe secret keys in Odoo's encrypted configuration\
    \ fields rather than code or databases. Restrict access to payment provider configuration\
    \ to authorized administrators only. Implement key rotation procedures that update\
    \ API keys without service interruption. Audit key usage to detect potential misuse.\n\
    \n### Webhook Security Implementation\n\nWebhook endpoints represent a critical\
    \ security surface that requires robust protection. Verify webhook signatures\
    \ using Stripe's signing secrets to prevent spoofing. Implement timestamp validation\
    \ to reject old webhook events that might represent replay attacks. Restrict webhook\
    \ processing to Stripe's official IP ranges.\n\nAdd rate limiting to webhook endpoints\
    \ to prevent denial-of-service attacks. Log all webhook processing attempts for\
    \ security monitoring. Implement alerting for suspicious webhook patterns like\
    \ unexpected event types. Regularly review webhook security configuration as part\
    \ of security audits.\n\n### Data Protection and Privacy\n\nCustomer payment data\
    \ flows through your integration with specific privacy implications. Minimize\
    \ data retention by storing only essential Stripe identifiers in Odoo. Implement\
    \ data purging procedures for test transactions and development data. Encrypt\
    \ sensitive customer information in both transit and storage.\n\nEstablish data\
    \ access controls that limit payment information to authorized personnel only.\
    \ Create audit trails for payment data access and modification. Implement GDPR-compliant\
    \ data handling procedures for European customers. Document data flow maps for\
    \ compliance reporting.\n\n### Authentication and Access Control\n\nSecure both\
    \ Stripe and Odoo accounts with strong authentication measures. Enable two-factor\
    \ authentication for all Stripe account users with administrative access. Implement\
    \ principle of least privilege for Odoo user roles accessing payment information.\
    \ Regularly review and revoke unused API keys and access tokens.\n\nMonitor both\
    \ systems for suspicious authentication attempts. Implement session timeout policies\
    \ for Odoo users with payment access. Create separation of duties between development\
    \ and production credential management. Establish emergency access procedures\
    \ for business continuity scenarios.\n\n## Performance Optimization\n\n### Webhook\
    \ Processing Optimization\n\nWebhook handling performance directly impacts payment\
    \ confirmation speed. Implement asynchronous processing for non-critical webhook\
    \ operations to reduce response times. Use background jobs for resource-intensive\
    \ tasks like email notifications and reporting updates. Queue webhook payloads\
    \ during peak loads to prevent system overload.\n\nMonitor webhook processing\
    \ latency through detailed performance metrics. Identify slow event handlers through\
    \ code profiling and optimization. Implement horizontal scaling for webhook endpoints\
    \ during high-volume periods. Use in-memory caching for frequently accessed reference\
    \ data during webhook processing.\n\n### API Call Efficiency\n\nReduce unnecessary\
    \ API calls between Odoo and Stripe to improve performance and avoid rate limits.\
    \ Implement smart caching for Stripe product and customer information that changes\
    \ infrequently. Batch API requests for operations that process multiple records\
    \ simultaneously. Use webhooks instead of polling for real-time updates whenever\
    \ possible.\n\nOptimize Odoo database queries that support payment processing\
    \ to reduce response times. Create database indexes on fields used in payment\
    \ reconciliation queries. Implement connection pooling for Stripe API clients\
    \ to reduce connection overhead. Monitor API usage patterns to identify optimization\
    \ opportunities.\n\n### Database Optimization\n\nPayment processing generates\
    \ substantial database activity that requires optimization. Partition transaction\
    \ tables by date to improve query performance for large datasets. Implement database\
    \ archiving for historical payment data that exceeds business requirements. Use\
    \ read replicas for reporting queries that analyze payment trends.\n\nOptimize\
    \ Odoo's accounting module configuration for high-volume payment processing. Tune\
    \ database parameters for write-intensive payment operations. Implement connection\
    \ management that prevents database connection exhaustion during peaks. Monitor\
    \ database performance metrics to identify emerging bottlenecks.\n\n### Caching\
    \ Strategies\n\nImplement multi-layer caching to reduce integration latency and\
    \ system load. Use Redis for frequently accessed Stripe configuration data like\
    \ product information and tax rates. Cache Odoo partner records during payment\
    \ processing to avoid database lookups. Implement cache warming for critical data\
    \ used in payment flows.\n\nDesign cache invalidation strategies that maintain\
    \ data consistency between systems. Invalidate customer caches when Stripe webhooks\
    \ indicate profile changes. Clear product caches when Odoo inventory updates affect\
    \ pricing or availability. Monitor cache hit ratios to optimize cache sizing and\
    \ retention policies."
