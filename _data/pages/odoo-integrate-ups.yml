  introduction: 'You stare at the shipping dashboard, your stomach a knot of frustration.
    Your Odoo 18 system shows the order as packed, but your UPS WorldShip portal displays
    a different reality—no tracking number, no shipment confirmation. Your customer
    service team fields angry calls about missing packages while your warehouse staff
    manually re-enter data, a soul-crushing duplication of effort that bleeds hours
    from every workday. This disconnect between your ERP and your shipping carrier
    creates a cascade of operational failures, from inaccurate inventory counts and
    delayed invoicing to a complete erosion of customer trust. Your business runs
    on synchronized data, and this manual handoff between Odoo and UPS has become
    a critical failure point that throttles your growth and scalds your team''s morale.


    This guide provides the definitive blueprint for a complete UPS to Odoo 18 integration.
    We will dismantle this manual process and replace it with a seamless, automated
    data conduit that synchronizes your operations in real-time. You will master the
    technical architecture, execute a step-by-step configuration with precise code
    examples, and implement robust error handling that ensures resilience. We will
    cover advanced topics like complex data mapping for international shipments, performance
    tuning for high-volume environments, and security hardening for your logistics
    data. This is not a superficial overview; it is a deep technical dive designed
    for developers and system architects who demand production-ready solutions.


    Plan for a dedicated implementation window. The core integration requires one
    to two days for a competent technical team, followed by a rigorous testing phase
    to validate data flows and exception handling. The complexity scales with your
    operational needs—a simple domestic shipment setup is straightforward, while incorporating
    advanced freight options or multi-warehouse shipping logic demands more meticulous
    planning. Your reward for this investment is a complete unification of your commerce
    engine with your logistics backbone, eliminating the friction that currently costs
    you time, money, and customer goodwill. Let''s build a system where your shipping
    data flows as effortlessly as your ideas.'
  main_content: "## Integration Architecture and Data Flow\n\nA robust UPS integration\
    \ for Odoo 18 operates on a hybrid architecture, blending Odoo's native framework\
    \ with UPS's modern API ecosystem. The system hinges on the Odoo UPS Connector\
    \ module, which acts as a dedicated middleware layer within your Odoo instance.\
    \ This module does not function as a passive bridge; it actively manages the entire\
    \ shipping lifecycle. Its core components include a configuration engine for storing\
    \ UPS credentials and shipping preferences, a real-time API client for communicating\
    \ with UPS servers, and a data mapping service that translates Odoo sales order\
    \ fields into UPS-compliant shipment requests. This design ensures that shipping\
    \ logic becomes a native capability of your ERP, not a bolted-on afterthought.\n\
    \nThe data flow initiates when a user validates a sales order or triggers the\
    \ \"Send to Shipping\" action within Odoo. The connector module intercepts this\
    \ event and packages the relevant order data—destination address, package dimensions,\
    \ product weight, and shipping service level—into a structured JSON object. This\
    \ object then makes a secure HTTPS POST request to the UPS Shipping API endpoint.\
    \ The API gateway authenticates the request using Odoo-stored access keys before\
    \ the UPS core logistics platform processes the shipment. This entire exchange,\
    \ from trigger to API call, typically completes in under two seconds.\n\nUpon\
    \ successful processing, the UPS API returns a rich response payload back to the\
    \ Odoo connector. This payload contains the critical tracking number, shipping\
    \ charges, a printable label in PDF or ZPL format, and the estimated delivery\
    \ date. The connector module parses this response and updates the original Odoo\
    \ sales order, the associated delivery order, and the stock move records. It attaches\
    \ the digital label to the delivery document and posts the shipping cost to the\
    \ appropriate analytical account. This closed-loop data flow creates a single\
    \ source of truth, ensuring every department from accounting to customer service\
    \ operates with identical, real-time shipping information.\n\nFor high-volume\
    \ operations, the architecture supports batch processing. Instead of firing an\
    \ API call for each individual order, the system can queue orders and process\
    \ them in scheduled batches. This approach optimizes API consumption and manages\
    \ server load during peak order periods. The system logs every API interaction—requests,\
    \ responses, and errors—in a dedicated log table. This provides a complete audit\
    \ trail for troubleshooting disputed shipments, analyzing shipping costs, and\
    \ generating compliance reports. You maintain full visibility into every data\
    \ exchange between your ERP and the carrier.\n\n## Step-by-Step Configuration\n\n### Prerequisites and Module Installation\nBegin by gathering your UPS API\
    \ credentials. You need a UPS Developer Kit account with active access to the\
    \ Shipping API. Secure your Client ID and Client Secret from the UPS Developer\
    \ Portal; these keys authenticate your Odoo instance with UPS's OAuth 2.0 service.\
    \ Within your Odoo 18 environment, install the official `delivery_ups` module\
    \ from the Odoo Apps store. Verify your installation activates the Delivery and\
    \ Shipping core features. Navigate to the Inventory app and access the Configuration\
    \ menu to find the Delivery Methods section. This is your control center for configuring\
    \ all carrier integrations.\n\n### Carrier Method Configuration\nCreate a new\
    \ delivery method and select UPS as the integration provider. Assign a descriptive\
    \ name like \"UPS Ground\" or \"UPS Next Day Air.\" The critical step involves\
    \ entering your API credentials in the UPS Account tab. Paste your Client ID and\
    \ Client Secret into the designated fields. Test the connection using the \"Test\
    \ Connection\" button; a successful test confirms your Odoo instance can communicate\
    \ with the UPS authentication server and retrieve a valid access token. This token\
    \ forms the foundation for all subsequent shipping API calls.\n\nConfigure the\
    \ default package dimensions and package type in the Packaging tab. Define common\
    \ presets like `Small Box (10x10x10 in)` or `Pallet (48x48x48 in)`. Assign a default\
    \ packaging to the delivery method to automate the rate calculation for sales\
    \ orders that lack specific package data. Proceed to the Shipping Services tab\
    \ and enable the specific UPS services your business uses—UPS Ground, UPS 3-Day\
    \ Select, UPS 2nd Day Air, and UPS Next Day Air. This selection filters the available\
    \ service options presented to users during the checkout and shipping process.\n\
    \n### Advanced Service and Label Configuration\nActivate the value-added services\
    \ you require in the Advanced Services tab. These options include Delivery Confirmation\
    \ (which provides signature proof of delivery), COD (Cash on Delivery) handling,\
    \ and Saturday Delivery flags. For international shipments, enable the necessary\
    \ international forms. Configure the label generation preferences in the Labels\
    \ tab. Choose your preferred label format—PDF for standard laser printers or ZPL\
    \ for dedicated Zebra label printers. Set the label resolution to 203 DPI for\
    \ most thermal printers or 300 DPI for high-resolution requirements.\n\nImplement\
    \ a custom rate calculation structure in the Pricing tab. You can choose between\
    \ a Carrier-based pricing model, which uses the real-time rates returned by the\
    \ UPS API, or a fixed price markup/discount structure. For businesses with negotiated\
    \ UPS contracts, the Fixed Price option allows you to define a custom rate sheet\
    \ that mirrors your commercial discount. Configure the shipping insurance rules\
    \ based on order value. Set an automatic insurance threshold that triggers insurance\
    \ purchase for high-value shipments, protecting your business against loss or\
    \ damage during transit.\n\n### Code Example: Custom Shipping Rule\nFor complex\
    \ scenarios, you may need to override the default shipping logic. Create a custom\
    \ Python method in your Odoo module to handle conditional shipping rules. For\
    \ example, this code snippet restricts hazardous materials to specific UPS services:\n\
    \n```python\nfrom odoo import models, fields, api\n\nclass DeliveryCarrier(models.Model):\n\
    \    _inherit = 'delivery.carrier'\n\n    def ups_rate_shipment(self, order):\n\
    \        # Call the core UPS rate calculation method\n        result = super(DeliveryCarrier,\
    \ self).ups_rate_shipment(order)\n\n        # Check for hazardous materials in\
    \ the order\n        hazardous_products = order.order_line.filtered(\n       \
    \     lambda line: line.product_id.hazardous_material\n        )\n        \n \
    \       if hazardous_products:\n            # Filter results to only allow approved\
    \ services\n            allowed_services = ['UPS_GROUND', 'UPS_02']\n        \
    \    result['services'] = [\n                service for service in result.get('services',\
    \ [])\n                if service['service_code'] in allowed_services\n      \
    \      ]\n        \n        return result\n```\n\nThis code extends the standard\
    \ rate calculation method, injecting a business rule that filters available services\
    \ based on product characteristics.\n\n## Data Mapping and Transformation \n\nThe integration's intelligence resides in its precise data mapping\
    \ between Odoo's sales order model and UPS's complex shipment schema. Each Odoo\
    \ field must transform into a specific UPS XML or JSON element. The `res.partner`\
    \ record for the delivery address maps directly to the UPS `ShipTo` object. The\
    \ partner's name populates the `CompanyName` field, the street field splits into\
    \ `AddressLine1` and `AddressLine2`, and the city, state, and ZIP code map to\
    \ their respective `City`, `StateProvinceCode`, and `PostalCode` fields. The system\
    \ automatically derives the `CountryCode` from the linked country record. This\
    \ translation ensures address validation and serviceability checks function correctly.\n\
    \nPackage data requires careful transformation from Odoo's product and packaging\
    \ models. The system calculates the total shipment weight by summing the `product_uom_qty`\
    \ multiplied by the `weight` field of each sale order line. It then maps this\
    \ total to the UPS `PackageWeight` object. You must define a unit of measure mapping,\
    \ converting Odoo's internal weight unit (pounds or kilograms) to the UPS-compliant\
    \ unit code, `LBS` or `KGS`. The integration uses the packaging template defined\
    \ in the delivery method to set the `PackagingType` code, such as `02` for a custom\
    \ box or `01` for a UPS letter.\n\nInternational shipments introduce complex data\
    \ mapping for customs declarations. Each order line item becomes a separate `Product`\
    \ object within the UPS `InvoiceLine` array. The system maps the product's `name`\
    \ to the `Description` field, the `product_uom_qty` to the `Quantity` field, and\
    \ the `price_unit` to the `UnitPrice` field. It uses the product's `weight` for\
    \ the `UnitWeight` and the product's `default_code` or `barcode` for the `ProductCode`.\
    \ The integration automatically classifies the product using the HS Code (`hs_code`\
    \ field) if available, a critical requirement for accurate customs clearance and\
    \ duty calculation.\n\nHandling edge cases demands conditional mapping logic.\
    \ For residential address detection, the system checks the `res.partner` record\
    \ for a `type` equal to 'delivery' and lacks a company name; it then sets the\
    \ UPS `ResidentialAddressIndicator` flag. For high-value goods, the system compares\
    \ the order total to a configurable threshold and automatically populates the\
    \ `InsuredValue` field. When products lack explicit weight data, the integration\
    \ falls back to a default weight value defined in the product category, preventing\
    \ rate calculation failures and ensuring every shipment receives a valid quote.\n\
    \n## Error Handling and Resilience\n\nThe integration encounters several common\
    \ error categories, each requiring a specific handling strategy. Authentication\
    \ failures, signaled by `UPS Api Error: 401 Unauthorized`, typically indicate\
    \ expired or invalid access tokens. The system should implement an automatic token\
    \ refresh mechanism, using the stored refresh token to obtain new credentials\
    \ without manual intervention. Address validation errors, such as `AV2002 - Address\
    \ Classification Not Found`, require a different approach. The integration should\
    \ flag the order for manual review and present the address discrepancy details\
    \ to the user, suggesting corrected addresses returned by the UPS API.\n\nRate\
    \ calculation and shipment creation errors often stem from data issues. A `111100\
    \ - The requested service is unavailable between the selected locations` error\
    \ means you must filter the unavailable service from the customer's options. A\
    \ `111210 - The package weight exceeds the limit for the selected service` error\
    \ should trigger a package splitting suggestion or a recommendation for a different\
    \ service level. The system must log these errors with full context—the failing\
    \ order ID, the exact API request payload, and the complete error response—to\
    \ accelerate diagnosis and resolution.\n\nImplement a retry mechanism for transient\
    \ network failures. Use an exponential backoff strategy for errors like `HTTP\
    \ 502 Bad Gateway` or `HTTP 503 Service Unavailable`. The system should queue\
    \ the failed request and retry it after a short delay, then after a longer delay,\
    \ aborting only after three consecutive failures. This resilience pattern handles\
    \ temporary UPS API outages without losing shipment data or requiring user intervention.\
    \ For persistent failures, the integration should escalate by creating an Odoo\
    \ Helpdesk ticket and notifying the logistics team via email or chat message.\n\
    \nDevelop a comprehensive recovery procedure for shipment creation failures that\
    \ occur after label generation. If the Odoo database update fails after a successful\
    \ UPS API call, you risk creating \"orphaned\" shipments in the UPS system. The\
    \ recovery script must reconcile these orphans by querying the UPS API for recent\
    \ shipments from your account that lack a corresponding Odoo tracking number.\
    \ This script should run daily to maintain synchronization and prevent billing\
    \ discrepancies for shipments that never entered your Odoo workflow.\n\n## Testing\
    \ and Validation\n\nConstruct a test suite that covers all shipping scenarios\
    \ your business encounters. Start with a simple domestic residential shipment,\
    \ the baseline case. Progress to commercial address delivery, international shipments\
    \ to key markets like the EU and Canada, and multi-package shipments with mixed\
    \ product types. Test edge cases like high-value goods requiring insurance, hazardous\
    \ material restrictions, and COD payments. Each test case must validate the complete\
    \ flow: rate calculation, label generation, tracking number assignment, and data\
    \ synchronization back to the sales order.\n\nValidate the data mapping accuracy\
    \ with a focused checklist. Confirm the ship-to address transmits without truncation\
    \ or corruption. Verify the package weight calculation matches a manual calculation\
    \ for the same order. Check that the correct shipping service codes display during\
    \ the checkout process. For international orders, validate that the HS Code, product\
    \ description, and country of manufacture populate the commercial invoice correctly.\
    \ Print sample labels to ensure barcode scannability and that all required information—address,\
    \ tracking number, service level—appears in the correct layout.\n\nExecute performance\
    \ benchmarks to gauge system behavior under load. Time the API response for a\
    \ single rate calculation; it should return in under two seconds. Test batch processing\
    \ of fifty orders to measure throughput and identify potential timeout issues.\
    \ Monitor Odoo server resources during these tests—CPU usage, memory consumption,\
    \ and database load—to ensure the integration scales with your order volume without\
    \ degrading the user experience for other Odoo functions. These benchmarks establish\
    \ a performance baseline for future optimization.\n\nImplement a pre-go-live validation\
    \ sprint. Create a set of test sales orders that mirror your live order profile.\
    \ Process these orders through the integrated system in a staging environment,\
    \ using UPS's test API endpoints to avoid generating real shipping labels or charges.\
    \ Perform a final reconciliation, comparing the expected shipping costs and data\
    \ outputs against the actual results. This dry run exposes configuration gaps\
    \ and data mapping errors before the integration touches live customer orders,\
    \ ensuring a smooth and professional cutover.\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n\
    Treat your UPS API credentials as sensitive secrets equivalent to database passwords.\
    \ Store the Client ID and Client Secret in Odoo's system parameters, not in plain\
    \ text within the delivery method configuration. Odoo encrypts these parameters\
    \ in the database, protecting them from direct database exposure. Restrict access\
    \ to the Delivery Method configuration menu to authorized logistics administrators\
    \ only. Use Odoo's built-in access rights system to create a dedicated \"Shipping\
    \ Manager\" group with explicit permissions for carrier management, preventing\
    \ unauthorized users from viewing or modifying the UPS integration settings.\n\
    \nEnsure all data transmission between Odoo and UPS occurs over secure, encrypted\
    \ channels. The integration must use the official UPS API endpoints, which all\
    \ enforce HTTPS/TLS 1.2 or higher. Verify your Odoo server's SSL/TLS configuration\
    \ supports strong cipher suites and has valid certificates. This encryption protects\
    \ shipment data, including customer addresses and product details, from interception\
    \ during transit. For businesses handling sensitive products, this data-in-transit\
    \ security is a non-negotiable compliance requirement.\n\nImplement strict data\
    \ retention and privacy controls for the shipping logs. The audit trail of API\
    \ requests and responses contains personal customer information. Schedule a periodic\
    \ purge job to anonymize or delete logs older than your required retention period,\
    \ typically 90 to 180 days. This practice aligns with data privacy regulations\
    \ like GDPR and CCPA, reducing your compliance footprint and protecting customer\
    \ data from unnecessary exposure. Configure these log retention policies during\
    \ the initial setup to establish a secure operational standard from day one.\n\
    \n## Performance Optimization\n\nThe UPS API rate calculation call often becomes\
    \ the primary performance bottleneck, especially during peak sales periods when\
    \ customers expect instant shipping quotes. Implement a multi-tiered caching strategy\
    \ to mitigate this. Cache rate quotes for common origin-destination-service combinations\
    \ for a short duration, such as fifteen minutes. Use Odoo's in-memory cache or\
    \ Redis to store these results. This approach reduces redundant API calls for\
    \ multiple orders going to the same destination on the same day, slashing response\
    \ times and conserving your API call quota.\n\nOptimize the package weight calculation\
    \ logic, a frequent source of performance degradation. Precompute and store the\
    \ product weight in the product template, and ensure the field uses a stored decimal\
    \ field, not a computed field that recalculates on every access. For complex kits\
    \ or configurable products, calculate the total weight during the sale order confirmation\
    \ process and store it in a dedicated field on the order. This precomputation\
    \ eliminates expensive real-time weight calculations when the shipping method\
    \ triggers, making the rate quote process almost instantaneous.\n\nFor high-volume\
    \ e-commerce operations, offload the synchronous shipping rate calculation from\
    \ the checkout process. Instead, display estimated shipping costs based on a pre-calculated\
    \ rate table or a simplified algorithm. Calculate the precise UPS rates asynchronously\
    \ in the background after order confirmation. This strategy guarantees a fast,\
    \ responsive checkout experience for customers, even during UPS API slowdowns\
    \ or outages. The system can then batch-process the precise rate calculations\
    \ and label generation for all confirmed orders on a scheduled interval, optimizing\
    \ both user experience and backend resource usage.\n\nMonitor the integration's\
    \ health with specific key performance indicators. Track the average response\
    \ time for the UPS Rate API and Ship API endpoints. Chart the daily volume of\
    \ successful versus failed API calls. Set up alerts for a rising error rate or\
    \ a sudden spike in response latency. These metrics provide early warning signs\
    \ of performance decay, whether from increased order volume, network issues, or\
    \ changes in the UPS API service. Proactive monitoring lets you address performance\
    \ issues before they impact your warehouse operations or customer delivery promises."
