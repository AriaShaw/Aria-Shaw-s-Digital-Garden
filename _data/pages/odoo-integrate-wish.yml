  main_content: "## Integration Architecture and Data Flow\n\n### Core\
    \ Integration Components\n\nThe Wish-Odoo integration operates on a hub-and-spoke\
    \ architecture with Odoo 18 as the central system. Wish provides a comprehensive\
    \ REST API for external system communication. Your integration acts as the middleware\
    \ that facilitates bidirectional data exchange between these platforms. The core\
    \ components include the Odoo ORM layer, custom integration modules, scheduled\
    \ actions, and webhook handlers for real-time updates.\n\nOdoo's modular framework\
    \ supports custom development through dedicated integration apps. You create these\
    \ apps using Python classes that extend Odoo's base models. The integration connects\
    \ to Wish API endpoints using Python's requests library with proper authentication\
    \ headers. Data transformation occurs within custom methods that map Wish data\
    \ structures to Odoo model fields. The system stores API credentials securely\
    \ using Odoo's parameter storage system.\n\n### Data Flow Patterns\n\nOrder synchronization\
    \ follows a pull-based pattern with scheduled actions. The integration queries\
    \ Wish for new orders at regular intervals, typically every 15-30 minutes. It\
    \ processes these orders through a multi-stage pipeline that validates, transforms,\
    \ and creates corresponding sales orders in Odoo. The system handles order updates\
    \ through a combination of scheduled checks and webhook notifications when Wish\
    \ supports them.\n\nProduct and inventory synchronization employs a push-based\
    \ approach. Changes to product quantities in Odoo trigger immediate updates to\
    \ your Wish listings through API calls. This ensures your stock levels remain\
    \ accurate across all sales channels. Product catalog updates can operate in both\
    \ directions, though most businesses prefer Odoo as the master product database.\
    \ The integration maps Odoo product categories to Wish tags and handles variant\
    \ creation for size and color options.\n\n### Webhook Implementation Strategy\n\
    \nWish webhooks provide real-time notifications for critical events like new orders\
    \ and order cancellations. Your integration configures these webhooks during the\
    \ initial setup process. The system registers endpoint URLs within your Odoo instance\
    \ that receive POST requests from Wish. These endpoints parse the incoming JSON\
    \ payloads and trigger immediate processing instead of waiting for scheduled synchronization\
    \ cycles.\n\nThe webhook handlers include robust verification mechanisms to validate\
    \ request authenticity. They check digital signatures and verify the source IP\
    \ addresses against Wish's published ranges. Each handler includes comprehensive\
    \ error logging and retry logic for failed processing attempts. This approach\
    \ minimizes data latency and ensures rapid order processing during high-volume\
    \ sales periods.\n\n## Step-by-Step Configuration\n\n### Wish API\
    \ Access Setup\n\nBegin with Wish Merchant Center configuration. Log into your\
    \ Wish account and navigate to the API Settings section. Generate new API credentials\
    \ with appropriate permissions for orders, products, and inventory. Wish provides\
    \ a Client ID, Client Secret, and Redirect URI for OAuth 2.0 authentication. Store\
    \ these credentials securely as you will reference them throughout the integration\
    \ setup.\n\nThe OAuth flow requires a callback endpoint in your Odoo instance.\
    \ Create a new controller in your custom module that handles the authorization\
    \ response. This endpoint captures the authorization code and exchanges it for\
    \ access and refresh tokens. Implement token refresh logic that automatically\
    \ renews expired tokens using the refresh token. Proper token management prevents\
    \ authentication failures during extended operation.\n\n### Odoo Custom Module\
    \ Development\n\nCreate a new Odoo module specifically for Wish integration. Define\
    \ the module structure with proper manifest file declarations. The __manifest__.py\
    \ file must specify dependencies on Odoo's sale, stock, and product modules. Create\
    \ models for storing Wish configuration parameters, API credentials, and synchronization\
    \ logs. These models maintain the integration state and provide audit trails for\
    \ troubleshooting.\n\nDevelop the core integration class that encapsulates all\
    \ API interactions. This class contains methods for API authentication, request\
    \ building, and response handling. Implement exponential backoff for rate limit\
    \ management and comprehensive error handling for network failures. The class\
    \ serves as the foundation for all data synchronization processes between Wish\
    \ and Odoo.\n\n```python\nclass WishIntegration(models.Model):\n    _name = 'wish.integration'\n\
    \    _description = 'Wish Platform Integration'\n    \n    name = fields.Char(string='Integration\
    \ Name', required=True)\n    client_id = fields.Char(string='Client ID', required=True)\n\
    \    client_secret = fields.Char(string='Client Secret', required=True)\n    access_token\
    \ = fields.Char(string='Access Token')\n    refresh_token = fields.Char(string='Refresh\
    \ Token')\n    token_expiry = fields.Datetime(string='Token Expiry')\n    last_sync\
    \ = fields.Datetime(string='Last Synchronization')\n    active = fields.Boolean(string='Active',\
    \ default=True)\n```\n\n### System Parameter Configuration\n\nConfigure Odoo system\
    \ parameters for Wish integration settings. Create a configuration page within\
    \ Odoo settings that allows administrators to input API credentials and control\
    \ synchronization behavior. This interface includes fields for default warehouses,\
    \ payment methods mapping, and shipping carrier associations. Store sensitive\
    \ data using Odoo's encrypted fields to maintain security.\n\nSet up scheduled\
    \ actions for periodic synchronization tasks. Configure these actions with appropriate\
    \ intervals based on your business requirements. Order synchronization typically\
    \ runs every 15 minutes, while inventory updates may occur more frequently during\
    \ peak seasons. Assign proper queue jobs to prevent system overload during high-volume\
    \ processing periods.\n\n### Data Mapping Configuration\n\nEstablish field mapping\
    \ between Wish order attributes and Odoo sales order fields. Create mapping tables\
    \ that define how Wish shipping addresses transform into Odoo partner records.\
    \ Configure product mapping that links Wish SKUs to Odoo product variants. This\
    \ mapping ensures consistent data translation during synchronization processes.\n\
    \nDevelop tax and currency handling rules that accommodate international sales.\
    \ Wish transactions may involve multiple currencies and tax jurisdictions. Your\
    \ integration must convert amounts to your base currency using exchange rates\
    \ from the transaction date. Implement tax calculation rules that comply with\
    \ your regional requirements and properly account for marketplace facilitator\
    \ tax collection.\n\n### Webhook Endpoint Setup\n\nRegister webhook endpoints\
    \ with Wish for real-time notifications. Create dedicated controllers in your\
    \ Odoo module that handle incoming webhook payloads. These endpoints verify request\
    \ signatures and process notifications for new orders, cancellations, and refunds.\
    \ Implement security measures that prevent unauthorized access to these publicly\
    \ accessible endpoints.\n\nTest webhook functionality using Wish's sandbox environment\
    \ or simulated requests. Verify that your endpoints correctly parse payloads and\
    \ trigger the appropriate processing workflows. Configure fallback mechanisms\
    \ that handle webhook delivery failures through periodic synchronization checks.\
    \ This redundancy ensures data consistency even if webhook delivery experiences\
    \ temporary issues.\n\n## Data Mapping and Transformation\n\n### Order\
    \ Data Transformation\n\nWish order data arrives as nested JSON structures with\
    \ specific field naming conventions. Your integration must flatten this structure\
    \ into Odoo's relational model. Map the Wish order ID to Odoo's origin field while\
    \ creating a unique sales order reference. Transform the customer information\
    \ into Odoo partner records, checking for existing matches based on email address\
    \ and shipping address.\n\nHandle Wish's combined name fields by parsing them\
    \ into Odoo's separate first name and last name fields. Process address information\
    \ with special attention to international format differences. Wish provides address\
    \ components in a single string that requires parsing into street, city, state,\
    \ and zip code fields. Implement address validation logic that standardizes these\
    \ values for Odoo's address structure.\n\n### Product Catalog Synchronization\n\
    \nProduct synchronization presents complex mapping challenges due to variant handling\
    \ differences. Wish treats each product variant as a separate listing, while Odoo\
    \ manages variants as attributes of a main product template. Your integration\
    \ must identify variant relationships and maintain them during synchronization.\
    \ Map Wish product IDs to Odoo product templates and handle variant creation through\
    \ attribute value assignment.\n\nTransform product descriptions and images between\
    \ the platforms. Wish supports multiple product images that must download and\
    \ attach to Odoo product records. Handle character encoding differences and HTML\
    \ formatting in product descriptions. Implement inventory level synchronization\
    \ that maintains separate stock quantities for each variant while respecting Odoo's\
    \ inventory management rules.\n\n### Pricing and Currency Conversion\n\nWish transactions\
    \ occur in multiple currencies, requiring careful price transformation. The integration\
    \ must convert order totals and line item prices to your Odoo base currency. Use\
    \ historical exchange rates from the order date rather than current rates for\
    \ accurate financial reporting. Store the original currency and amount in custom\
    \ fields for reconciliation purposes.\n\nManage promotional pricing and discount\
    \ handling across both platforms. Wish applies various discount types including\
    \ product-specific promotions and shipping discounts. Map these to Odoo's discount\
    \ field structure while maintaining audit trails for the original transaction\
    \ values. Handle tax calculation differences between Wish's marketplace collection\
    \ and your regional tax requirements.\n\n### Shipping and Fulfillment Mapping\n\
    \nWish shipping information requires transformation into Odoo's delivery order\
    \ structure. Map Wish shipping methods to Odoo delivery carriers and service levels.\
    \ Extract tracking numbers from fulfillment data and associate them with the corresponding\
    \ Odoo stock moves. Handle partial shipments and split orders that occur when\
    \ items ship from multiple warehouses.\n\nTransform Wish return requests into\
    \ Odoo return orders with proper reason codes and restocking policies. Map return\
    \ status updates between both systems to maintain visibility throughout the return\
    \ process. Implement synchronization for refund processing that updates Odoo accounting\
    \ entries based on Wish refund transactions.\n\n## Error Handling and Resilience\
    \\n\n### API Rate Limit Management\n\nWish imposes strict rate limits\
    \ on API calls to prevent system overload. Your integration must implement intelligent\
    \ throttling that respects these limits while maintaining synchronization performance.\
    \ Track API call counts within rolling time windows and introduce delays when\
    \ approaching limit thresholds. Use exponential backoff algorithms for retry attempts\
    \ after receiving rate limit errors.\n\nHandle 429 Too Many Requests responses\
    \ with proper retry-after header parsing. The integration should pause synchronization\
    \ tasks until the rate limit resets, then resume processing. Implement queue prioritization\
    \ that processes critical updates like order acknowledgments before background\
    \ synchronization tasks. This ensures business-critical operations receive priority\
    \ during constrained bandwidth periods.\n\n### Data Validation and Correction\n\
    \nImplement comprehensive data validation at multiple stages of the synchronization\
    \ process. Validate incoming Wish data for required fields and format compliance\
    \ before transformation. Check for data consistency issues like mismatched currencies\
    \ or invalid product references. The system should flag problematic records for\
    \ manual review rather than failing entire synchronization batches.\n\nDevelop\
    \ automated correction routines for common data issues. Handle missing country\
    \ codes by inferring them from postal patterns. Correct case sensitivity mismatches\
    \ in product SKUs through fuzzy matching algorithms. Create exception handling\
    \ workflows that notify administrators of persistent data problems requiring manual\
    \ intervention. These proactive measures maintain synchronization reliability\
    \ despite data quality variations.\n\n### Network Failure Recovery\n\nNetwork\
    \ instability can disrupt API communication between your Odoo instance and Wish\
    \ servers. Implement robust retry mechanisms with increasing delay intervals between\
    \ attempts. Log connection failures with detailed context for troubleshooting\
    \ persistent connectivity issues. Use circuit breaker patterns that temporarily\
    \ disable integration components during extended outage periods to prevent system\
    \ resource exhaustion.\n\nMaintain synchronization checkpoints that track processed\
    \ records across integration cycles. After recovering from network failures, the\
    \ system should resume from the last successful checkpoint rather than reprocessing\
    \ all data. This prevents duplicate record creation and reduces unnecessary API\
    \ load during recovery periods. Implement data reconciliation procedures that\
    \ identify and resolve synchronization gaps following extended outages.\n\n###\
    \ Order of Operations Protection\n\nMaintain strict execution order for dependent\
    \ synchronization tasks. Process product updates before order synchronization\
    \ to ensure product references exist when creating sales orders. Implement dependency\
    \ tracking that queues related operations and executes them in the correct sequence.\
    \ Use database transactions to maintain data consistency when multiple related\
    \ records create or update together.\n\nHandle partial failure scenarios where\
    \ some operations succeed while others fail within a single synchronization batch.\
    \ Implement compensation logic that rolls back related changes when critical operations\
    \ fail. This prevents data inconsistency where orders create without corresponding\
    \ products or inventory updates. Use Odoo's built-in transaction management to\
    \ ensure atomic operations across related data modifications.\n\n## Testing and\
    \ Validation\n\n### Development Environment Setup\n\nEstablish a dedicated\
    \ testing environment that mirrors your production Odoo instance. Create a separate\
    \ Wish developer account with sandbox access for integration testing. Populate\
    \ the test environment with representative data that covers all your product types,\
    \ customer scenarios, and order variations. This environment serves as your primary\
    \ validation platform before deploying changes to production.\n\nDevelop comprehensive\
    \ test cases that exercise every integration pathway. Create test scenarios for\
    \ new orders, order modifications, cancellations, product updates, and inventory\
    \ changes. Include edge cases like international orders, special characters in\
    \ addresses, and products with multiple variants. Document expected outcomes for\
    \ each test case to streamline validation during the testing process.\n\n### Integration\
    \ Validation Procedures\n\nExecute synchronization tests with controlled data\
    \ sets to verify end-to-end functionality. Create test orders in Wish and verify\
    \ they appear in Odoo with correct field mappings. Validate that order acknowledgments\
    \ transmit back to Wish with proper status updates. Check inventory synchronization\
    \ by modifying stock levels in Odoo and confirming the changes reflect in Wish\
    \ product listings.\n\nPerform load testing to assess integration performance\
    \ under realistic transaction volumes. Generate bulk order imports and measure\
    \ processing times against your business requirements. Test synchronization during\
    \ peak loads to identify potential bottlenecks or resource constraints. Validate\
    \ that the integration maintains stability and data consistency during sustained\
    \ high-volume operation.\n\n### Data Accuracy Verification\n\nImplement automated\
    \ validation checks that compare data between systems after synchronization. Develop\
    \ reconciliation reports that highlight discrepancies in order totals, product\
    \ quantities, or customer information. Create data integrity monitors that run\
    \ periodic checks and alert administrators to synchronization problems. These\
    \ proactive monitoring tools catch issues before they impact business operations.\n\
    \nTest error condition handling by simulating common failure scenarios. Disrupt\
    \ network connectivity during synchronization to verify proper recovery mechanisms.\
    \ Inject malformed data into test requests to validate error handling and logging.\
    \ Confirm that the integration gracefully handles API changes by modifying response\
    \ structures and verifying adaptation behavior.\n\n### User Acceptance Testing\n\
    \nEngage business users in final validation before production deployment. Create\
    \ test scripts that cover real-world business processes from order receipt through\
    \ fulfillment. Have users verify that the integrated system meets their operational\
    \ needs and workflow requirements. Collect feedback on data presentation and interface\
    \ elements that affect daily usage.\n\nDocument performance benchmarks and establish\
    \ ongoing monitoring thresholds. Measure synchronization latency, API response\
    \ times, and error rates during the testing period. Use these benchmarks to establish\
    \ performance baselines for production monitoring. Create operational runbooks\
    \ that guide support teams through common troubleshooting procedures and escalation\
    \ paths.\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n### API Credential Protection\n\
    \nSecure Wish API credentials using Odoo's encrypted fields rather than storing\
    \ them in plain text. Implement credential rotation policies that periodically\
    \ refresh access tokens and API keys. Restrict access to integration configuration\
    \ pages to authorized administrators only. Use Odoo's group-based permission system\
    \ to control who can modify integration settings.\n\nImplement secure credential\
    \ storage with proper key management practices. Never log API keys or access tokens\
    \ in debug output or application logs. Use environment variables for sensitive\
    \ configuration parameters in production deployments. Establish procedures for\
    \ immediate credential revocation in case of suspected security breaches.\n\n\
    ### Data Transmission Security\n\nEnforce TLS encryption for all API communication\
    \ between Odoo and Wish servers. Verify certificate validity during API calls\
    \ to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. Implement request signing where supported\
    \ by the Wish API to ensure message integrity. Validate all incoming webhook requests\
    \ using signature verification to prevent spoofing.\n\nSecure webhook endpoints\
    \ with additional authentication measures beyond Wish's built-in signatures. Consider\
    \ IP whitelisting for incoming webhook requests when feasible. Implement rate\
    \ limiting on webhook endpoints to prevent denial-of-service attacks. Log all\
    \ webhook interactions for security auditing and anomaly detection.\n\n### Access\
    \ Control Implementation\n\nApply principle of least privilege to integration\
    \ components. Create dedicated API credentials with minimal required permissions\
    \ rather than using administrator accounts. Configure Odoo record rules that restrict\
    \ integration-mediated data access to appropriate business units. Implement audit\
    \ logging that tracks all data modifications performed through the integration.\n\
    \nSecure the Odoo instance hosting the integration with standard hardening measures.\
    \ Apply regular security updates to both Odoo and underlying system components.\
    \ Use web application firewalls to detect and block malicious requests. Conduct\
    \ periodic security reviews of integration code and configuration to identify\
    \ potential vulnerabilities.\n\n## Performance Optimization\n\n###\
    \ Database Indexing Strategy\n\nAnalyze query patterns generated by the integration\
    \ and create targeted database indexes. Add indexes to frequently searched fields\
    \ like Wish order IDs, product SKUs, and synchronization timestamps. Optimize\
    \ Odoo's ORM queries by selecting only necessary fields and using proper prefetch\
    \ patterns. Monitor query performance during high-volume synchronization and refine\
    \ indexes based on actual usage patterns.\n\nImplement database maintenance routines\
    \ that keep statistics current and rebuild fragmented indexes. Schedule these\
    \ maintenance activities during low-traffic periods to minimize user impact. Use\
    \ Odoo's built-in query profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks in\
    \ custom integration code. Optimize complex data transformations by breaking them\
    \ into smaller, more efficient database operations.\n\n### Caching Implementation\n\
    \nImplement strategic caching for reference data that changes infrequently. Cache\
    \ product information, customer details, and shipping method mappings to reduce\
    \ database queries during synchronization. Use Odoo's caching mechanisms or Redis\
    \ for distributed caching in multi-worker environments. Establish cache invalidation\
    \ policies that refresh data when underlying information changes.\n\nCache Wish\
    \ API responses where appropriate to reduce external API calls. Implement response\
    \ caching with proper TTL values for product catalog information and static reference\
    \ data. Use conditional requests with ETag headers where supported by the Wish\
    \ API to minimize data transfer. Cache transformed data structures to avoid reprocessing\
    \ identical transformation operations.\n\n### Synchronization Process Optimization\n\
    \nOptimize synchronization batches based on your business volume and performance\
    \ requirements. Adjust batch sizes to balance memory usage against database transaction\
    \ overhead. Implement parallel processing for independent synchronization tasks\
    \ where possible. Use Odoo's queue job system to distribute workload across multiple\
    \ workers and prevent blocking operations.\n\nMonitor synchronization performance\
    \ and identify bottlenecks through detailed logging. Measure time spent on API\
    \ calls, data transformation, and database operations. Optimize the slowest components\
    \ through code refinement, additional indexing, or architectural changes. Implement\
    \ progressive synchronization that prioritizes recent data while processing historical\
    \ information during low-load periods."
