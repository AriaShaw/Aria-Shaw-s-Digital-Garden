  main_content: '## System Preparation and Dependency Installation


    ### Ubuntu 22.04 Baseline Configuration


    Begin with a comprehensive system update to ensure all existing packages reach
    their latest stable versions. Execute `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y`
    to refresh your package repositories and apply security patches. This foundational
    step prevents conflicts between Odoo dependencies and system libraries. Reboot
    your server if the kernel receives an update during this process.


    Create a dedicated system user account for Odoo operations using `sudo adduser
    --system --group --home /opt/odoo odoo`. This security measure isolates Odoo processes
    from privileged accounts. The designated home directory provides a consistent
    location for application files and custom modules. User isolation limits potential
    damage from security vulnerabilities.


    Install essential Python development tools with `sudo apt install -y python3-pip
    python3-dev`. These packages provide the compilation infrastructure for Python
    wheels and native extensions. Odoo 18 requires Python 3.8+ which Ubuntu 22.04
    includes in its default repositories. The development headers enable compilation
    of performance-critical Python packages.


    ### Database Server Installation


    PostgreSQL serves as the primary database backend for Odoo operations. Install
    the database server using `sudo apt install -y postgresql postgresql-contrib`.
    The contrib package adds valuable administrative extensions for database management.
    This installation creates a postgres system user that owns the database cluster
    and processes.


    Switch to the postgres user account with `sudo su - postgres`. Create a dedicated
    database user for Odoo using `createuser --createdb --username postgres --no-createrole
    --no-superuser --pwprompt odoo`. This command restricts the database user to appropriate
    privilege levels for security. Record the password you assign for later configuration
    steps.


    Return to your normal user account and verify the database user creation with
    `sudo -u postgres psql -c "SELECT usename FROM pg_user WHERE usename=''odoo''"`.
    This confirmation ensures your database layer maintains proper user segregation.
    The Odoo database user should possess permissions for database creation and basic
    operations only.


    ### System Package Dependencies


    Odoo requires numerous system libraries for PDF generation, XML processing, and
    other enterprise functions. Install these dependencies using `sudo apt install
    -y build-essential libssl-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libldap2-dev libsasl2-dev
    libjpeg-dev libpq-dev libffi-dev fontconfig`. These packages provide native code
    support for Python modules that Odoo utilizes.


    Node.js and Less CSS compiler support the Odoo web interface features. Install
    the Node.js runtime from the standard repositories with `sudo apt install -y nodejs
    npm`. This installation provides the necessary JavaScript execution environment
    for frontend asset processing. Link the nodejs binary to the expected node name
    using `sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node`.


    Install the Less CSS compiler globally using `sudo npm install -g less`. This
    tool transforms Less stylesheets into standard CSS that browsers render. The Odoo
    framework employs Less for its modular styling system and theme development. Verify
    the installation completes without permission errors or dependency warnings.


    ## Odoo 18 Application Deployment


    ### Python Environment Configuration


    Create a dedicated Python virtual environment for Odoo isolation. Install the
    virtualenv package using `sudo pip3 install virtualenv`. This tool creates self-contained
    Python environments that prevent package conflicts. Navigate to the Odoo user
    home directory with `sudo mkdir /opt/odoo/odoo-server` and adjust ownership using
    `sudo chown odoo:odoo /opt/odoo/odoo-server`.


    Switch to the Odoo user account with `sudo su - odoo`. Create the virtual environment
    inside the user home directory using `virtualenv /opt/odoo/odoo-server/venv`.
    This command builds a complete Python runtime isolation layer. Activate the virtual
    environment with `source /opt/odoo/odoo-server/venv/bin/activate` before proceeding
    with Odoo installation.


    Install Wheel package support using `pip install wheel`. This precompilation format
    accelerates package installation and reduces build dependencies. The Wheel infrastructure
    ensures reliable deployment of binary Python extensions without compilation tools
    on production systems. Verify the virtual environment operates independently from
    the system Python.


    ### Odoo Source Code Installation


    Download the Odoo 18 source code using Git version control. Install Git with `sudo
    apt install -y git` if not present. Clone the Odoo repository using `git clone
    https://github.com/odoo/odoo.git /opt/odoo/odoo-server/odoo --branch 18.0 --depth
    1`. The depth parameter limits history retrieval to conserve bandwidth and storage
    space.


    Install Python dependencies from the Odoo requirements file using `pip install
    -r /opt/odoo/odoo-server/odoo/requirements.txt`. This command processes all necessary
    Python packages for Odoo operation. The installation may take several minutes
    as it compiles native extensions. Monitor for any compilation errors that indicate
    missing system dependencies.


    Create a custom addons directory for third-party modules using `mkdir /opt/odoo/odoo-server/custom-addons`.
    This separation maintains clear boundaries between core Odoo code and extensions.
    Set proper ownership with `sudo chown -R odoo:odoo /opt/odoo/odoo-server`. The
    directory structure now supports modular application development.


    ### Odoo Configuration File Setup


    Create the Odoo configuration file at `/etc/odoo.conf` using `sudo touch /etc/odoo.conf`
    and `sudo chown odoo:odoo /etc/odoo.conf`. This central configuration file controls
    all aspects of Odoo operation. Apply strict permissions with `sudo chmod 640 /etc/odoo.conf`
    to prevent unauthorized access to database credentials.


    Populate the configuration file with essential parameters. The [options] section
    should contain `admin_passwd = your_secure_master_password` for database management
    security. Set `db_host = localhost` and `db_user = odoo` with the corresponding
    database password. Specify `addons_path = /opt/odoo/odoo-server/odoo/addons,/opt/odoo/odoo-server/custom-addons`
    to define module search paths.


    Configure operational parameters for production use. Set `logfile = /var/log/odoo/odoo-server.log`
    to centralize logging output. Define `log_level = warn` to balance detail and
    performance. Specify `proxy_mode = True` when operating behind a reverse proxy.
    These settings establish a foundation for production monitoring and troubleshooting.


    ## Service Configuration and Process Management


    ### Systemd Service Integration


    Create a systemd service file to manage Odoo as a system service. Place the file
    at `/etc/systemd/system/odoo.service` with `sudo touch /etc/systemd/system/odoo.service`.
    This service definition enables proper process supervision and automatic startup.
    Systemd provides robust process management capabilities beyond simple init scripts.


    Define the service configuration with precise execution parameters. The [Unit]
    section should contain `Description=Odoo 18 ERP System` and `After=postgresql.service`
    to establish service dependencies. The [Service] section must specify `Type=simple`
    with `User=odoo` and `Group=odoo` for security context. Set `ExecStart=/opt/odoo/odoo-server/venv/bin/python3
    /opt/odoo/odoo-server/odoo/odoo-bin -c /etc/odoo.conf` for the execution command.


    Configure process management and resource limits for stability. Set `Restart=on-failure`
    and `RestartSec=5` to handle temporary issues automatically. Define `TimeoutStartSec=300`
    to accommodate initial database operations. Specify `KillMode=mixed` for graceful
    shutdown procedures. These parameters ensure the service recovers from common
    runtime problems.


    Enable the Odoo service to start automatically with `sudo systemctl enable odoo`.
    This command links the service definition into the system startup sequence. Start
    the service immediately with `sudo systemctl start odoo` and verify its status
    using `sudo systemctl status odoo`. The output should show an active (running)
    state without error messages.


    ### Logging Infrastructure Setup


    Create a dedicated log directory with proper permissions using `sudo mkdir /var/log/odoo`
    and `sudo chown odoo:odoo /var/log/odoo`. This centralized location stores all
    Odoo application logs for troubleshooting and auditing. The directory separation
    maintains clean organization of system versus application logging.


    Configure log rotation to prevent disk space exhaustion. Create a logrotate configuration
    file at `/etc/logrotate.d/odoo` with appropriate rotation policies. Set `weekly`
    rotation with `rotate 8` to maintain two months of historical logs. Specify `create
    640 odoo odoo` to preserve file ownership after rotation. The compression directive
    reduces storage requirements for older log files.


    Monitor log output during initial startup using `sudo journalctl -u odoo -f`.
    This command displays real-time service messages from systemd. Look for database
    connection success messages and HTTP service initialization. Address any error
    messages related to permissions or missing dependencies before proceeding to the
    next configuration phase.


    ### Process Optimization Parameters


    Adjust Odoo configuration for optimal performance based on your hardware resources.
    Set `workers = 2` for systems with 2-4 CPU cores, scaling appropriately for larger
    systems. Define `limit_memory_hard = 2684354560` and `limit_memory_soft = 2147483648`
    to establish memory boundaries for worker processes. These limits prevent memory
    exhaustion from module defects.


    Configure database connection pooling with `db_maxconn = 64` to manage concurrent
    database operations. Set `list_db = False` in production environments to enhance
    security through information disclosure prevention. Define `max_cron_threads =
    2` to limit background task processing resources. These parameters fine-tune resource
    allocation for production workloads.


    ## Nginx Reverse Proxy Configuration


    ### SSL Termination Setup


    Install Nginx web server using `sudo apt install -y nginx`. This high-performance
    web server handles SSL termination and static file serving. Obtain an SSL certificate
    from Let''s Encrypt using Certbot with `sudo apt install -y certbot python3-certbot-nginx`.
    Execute `sudo certbot --nginx -d your-domain.com` to request and install a trusted
    certificate.


    Configure Nginx as a reverse proxy for Odoo application traffic. Create a server
    block configuration at `/etc/nginx/sites-available/odoo` with proper upstream
    directives. The configuration should proxy requests to `http://127.0.0.1:8069`
    where Odoo listens by default. Enable the site configuration using `sudo ln -s
    /etc/nginx/sites-available/odoo /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/`.


    Implement security headers and performance optimizations in the Nginx configuration.
    Set `proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host` and `proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For
    $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for` to preserve original client information. Define `proxy_read_timeout
    720s` and `proxy_connect_timeout 720s` to accommodate long-running operations.
    These settings maintain application functionality through the proxy layer.


    ### Static Content Optimization


    Configure Nginx to serve static files directly for improved performance. Create
    location blocks that match Odoo static paths including `/web/static/` and `/web/image/`.
    Set aggressive caching headers for static resources with `expires 1y` and `add_header
    Cache-Control "public, immutable"`. This approach reduces application server load
    and accelerates page loading.


    Enable Gzip compression for text-based content types. Configure `gzip_types` to
    include JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and XML responses. Set `gzip_comp_level 6` to balance
    compression ratio with CPU overhead. The compression reduces bandwidth consumption
    and improves transfer times for clients with limited connectivity.


    Verify the Nginx configuration syntax with `sudo nginx -t`. This validation check
    identifies syntax errors before applying changes. Reload the Nginx service with
    `sudo systemctl reload nginx` to activate the new configuration. Test the proxy
    functionality by accessing your domain with HTTPS and verifying Odoo loads without
    mixed content warnings.


    ## Database Optimization and Maintenance


    ### PostgreSQL Performance Tuning


    Adjust PostgreSQL configuration for Odoo workload characteristics. Locate the
    main configuration file at `/etc/postgresql/14/main/postgresql.conf`. Modify memory
    settings based on your available system resources. Set `shared_buffers = 25%`
    of available RAM and `effective_cache_size = 50%` of total RAM. These parameters
    optimize database memory utilization.


    Configure checkpoint and WAL settings for better write performance. Set `checkpoint_completion_target
    = 0.9` to spread write operations more evenly. Adjust `wal_buffers = 16MB` to
    accommodate transaction volume. Define `random_page_cost = 1.1` for SSD storage
    systems. These tuning parameters accelerate common database operations in Odoo.


    Restart PostgreSQL to apply configuration changes with `sudo systemctl restart
    postgresql`. Monitor database performance using PostgreSQL statistics views like
    `pg_stat_database` and `pg_stat_user_tables`. Identify slow queries using `pg_stat_statements`
    extension for targeted optimization efforts.


    ### Automated Backup Procedures


    Implement a comprehensive backup strategy for Odoo filestore and database. Create
    a backup directory with `sudo mkdir /opt/odoo/backups` and `sudo chown odoo:odoo
    /opt/odoo/backups`. Develop a shell script that executes `pg_dump` for database
    backup and rsync for filestore duplication. Include rotation logic to manage backup
    storage consumption.


    Schedule automated backups using cron jobs. Access the crontab for the Odoo user
    with `sudo crontab -u odoo -e`. Add entries for daily database dumps and weekly
    full backups. Configure log rotation for backup operations to monitor success
    and failure patterns. Test restoration procedures regularly to validate backup
    integrity.


    Monitor backup completion and storage capacity. Implement alerting for backup
    failures through log monitoring or script exit code checking. Track backup storage
    growth to anticipate capacity requirements. Document restoration procedures for
    disaster recovery scenarios to minimize downtime during critical incidents.


    ## Security Hardening and Access Control


    ### Network Security Configuration


    Configure firewall rules to restrict unnecessary network exposure. Ubuntu 22.04
    includes UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) for simplified management. Enable SSH access
    with `sudo ufw allow OpenSSH` and HTTP/HTTPS with `sudo ufw allow ''Nginx Full''`.
    Activate the firewall with `sudo ufw enable` to enforce these rules.


    Restrict database network access to localhost only. Verify PostgreSQL configuration
    at `/etc/postgresql/14/main/pg_hba.conf` contains `host all all 127.0.0.1/32 md5`
    for IPv4 connections. Set `listen_addresses = ''localhost''` in the main PostgreSQL
    configuration file. These measures prevent external database connection attempts.


    Implement fail2ban protection against brute force attacks. Install with `sudo
    apt install -y fail2ban` and create a Odoo-specific jail configuration. Monitor
    Odoo authentication logs for repeated failed login attempts. Configure appropriate
    ban durations and whitelist trusted IP addresses to maintain accessibility.


    ### Application Security Measures


    Enforce strong password policies for Odoo user accounts. Configure password complexity
    requirements through Odoo settings with minimum length and character variety.
    Enable two-factor authentication for administrative accounts to add an additional
    security layer. Regular password rotation policies reduce the impact of credential
    compromise.


    Implement appropriate access controls for Odoo database operations. Create separate
    database users for different security contexts when integrating with external
    systems. Apply principle of least privilege to all database account permissions.
    Regular access reviews identify unnecessary privileges that require revocation.


    Secure the Odoo configuration file with strict permissions. Verify that `/etc/odoo.conf`
    has `640` permissions with `odoo:odoo` ownership. The master admin password in
    the configuration file should use strong, unique values different from other system
    credentials. Regular security audits identify configuration drift from established
    baselines.


    ### System Monitoring and Alerting


    Implement comprehensive logging for security event detection. Configure Odoo to
    log authentication attempts and administrative actions. Centralize logs using
    syslog or dedicated log management solutions. Regular log analysis identifies
    suspicious patterns that indicate security incidents.


    Set up system monitoring for resource utilization and service availability. Monitor
    disk space, memory usage, and CPU load to detect performance anomalies. Configure
    alerting for service downtime through health checks against the Odoo web interface.
    Proactive monitoring prevents minor issues from escalating into major incidents.


    Establish regular security patch management procedures. Subscribe to security
    announcements for Ubuntu, PostgreSQL, and Odoo. Test patches in a staging environment
    before production deployment. Maintain a documented rollback procedure for problematic
    updates to minimize business disruption.


    ## Performance Monitoring and Optimization


    ### Resource Utilization Analysis


    Monitor Odoo worker process resource consumption using system tools. Implement
    `htop` for real-time process monitoring and `iotop` for disk I/O analysis. Track
    memory usage patterns to identify potential leaks in custom modules. Establish
    baseline performance metrics during normal operation for comparison during issues.


    Analyze database performance through PostgreSQL statistics. Monitor query execution
    times using `pg_stat_statements` extension. Identify frequently executed queries
    that benefit from optimization. Track index usage statistics to locate missing
    indexes that degrade performance.


    Implement application performance monitoring (APM) tools for detailed code-level
    insights. Tools like py-spy provide Python profiling without code instrumentation.
    Monitor HTTP request response times to identify slow database queries or complex
    business logic. Performance data guides optimization efforts toward maximum impact.


    ### Caching Strategy Implementation


    Configure Redis for Odoo caching and session storage. Install Redis server using
    `sudo apt install -y redis-server`. Configure Odoo to use Redis for cache with
    `cache_redis = True` in the configuration file. Set appropriate expiration times
    for different data types to balance freshness and performance.


    Implement browser-side caching policies through Nginx configuration. Set aggressive
    caching headers for static assets that rarely change. Configure conditional requests
    using ETags for dynamic content that updates frequently. The caching hierarchy
    reduces server load and improves user experience.


    Utilize Odoo''s built-in caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data. Configure
    `osv_memory_count_limit` to control in-memory record caching. Monitor cache hit
    ratios to assess effectiveness of caching strategies. Adjust cache sizes based
    on available system memory and workload patterns.


    ### Database Maintenance Procedures


    Schedule regular PostgreSQL maintenance operations during low-usage periods. Perform
    `VACUUM ANALYZE` operations to update table statistics and reclaim storage. Monitor
    table bloat using `pgstattuple` extension to identify tables that benefit from
    aggressive vacuuming. Regular maintenance preserves query performance over time.


    Implement connection pooling to reduce database connection overhead. Use PgBouncer
    or PostgreSQL''s built-in connection pooler to manage database connections. Configure
    appropriate pool sizes based on concurrent user count and worker processes. Connection
    pooling improves resource utilization and application responsiveness.


    Monitor long-running queries and database locks that impact performance. Configure
    PostgreSQL log_min_duration_statement to identify slow queries automatically.
    Set up alerts for long-held locks that block other database operations. Proactive
    identification of performance issues prevents user experience degradation.'
