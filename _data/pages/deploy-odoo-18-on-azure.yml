  introduction: 'Microsoft Azure''s D4s_v5 (General Purpose) instance delivers the
    compute and memory resources that Odoo 18 requires for production deployments
    serving Medium Business (40-100 users). The 4 dedicated vCPUs handle concurrent
    user requests without CPU steal, while 16GB RAM provides sufficient headroom for
    PostgreSQL query caching.


    Managed Odoo providers restrict customization, charge premium rates for additional
    storage or compute resources, and create vendor lock-in through proprietary backup
    formats and limited data export options. When you deploy on infrastructure you
    control, you eliminate these restrictions while gaining operational knowledge
    that survives vendor changes and protects against arbitrary price increases.'
  deployment_guide: 'Azure''s virtual machine nomenclature encodes critical performance
    characteristics. The D-series (D4s_v5) represents general-purpose compute with
    balanced CPU-to-memory ratios, while the B-series (B2ms) uses burstable CPU allocation.
    The "v5" designation indicates latest AMD EPYC or Intel Ice Lake processors. The
    "s" suffix confirms premium SSD storage—essential for PostgreSQL performance.


    Log into Azure Portal at portal.azure.com. Create a Resource Group named "odoo-production-rg"
    in your chosen region. Deploy Virtual Machine with Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS. For
    Size, choose B2ms ($60.59/month) for 20-50 users or D4s_v5 ($140.16/month) for
    40-100 users. Use SSH public key authentication.


    Configure storage with 128GB Premium SSD for OS disk to accommodate Odoo application
    files and logs. Create separate 256GB data disk for Odoo''s filestore. Network
    Security Group requires precise configuration: SSH (port 22) restricted to your
    office IP, HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) open to all. Do NOT expose port
    8069 directly.


    Azure Database for PostgreSQL decision carries operational weight. Managed service
    costs $50-150 monthly but handles automated backups with point-in-time restore,
    automatic updates, and high availability. Self-hosting PostgreSQL on VM eliminates
    this cost but requires database expertise.


    Install Docker and Docker Compose using official repository. Create Odoo project
    structure in mounted data disk. Configure docker-compose.yml with PostgreSQL 16
    and Odoo 18, tuning for D4s_v5''s 16GB RAM. Install NGINX for reverse proxy, obtain
    Let''s Encrypt SSL certificates via Certbot.


    Total costs: B2ms self-hosted runs $113-123/month, D4s_v5 pay-as-you-go costs
    $249/month or $193 with reserved instance, premium configuration with managed
    database reaches $336/month. Reserved instance strategy for one-year commitment
    provides 40% savings on compute.

    '
  conclusion: 'The Deploy Odoo 18 on Microsoft Azure: Complete 2025 Guide system you
    deployed demonstrates that production-grade Odoo infrastructure doesn''t require
    managed service providers or enterprise support contracts. You configured every
    component yourself—from Microsoft Azure firewall rules through PostgreSQL parameter
    tuning to Let''s Encrypt SSL automation—and gained operational knowledge that
    survives vendor changes, price increases, and service discontinuations.


    This hands-on deployment approach delivers advantages that extend beyond immediate
    cost savings. You understand exactly how Odoo connects to PostgreSQL, how NGINX
    handles SSL termination and request proxying, where log files accumulate, and
    which processes consume memory under load. That knowledge eliminates the helpless
    dependency on support tickets and vendor response times that paralyzes businesses
    when production issues emerge during month-end financial closes or customer deadline
    pressure.


    Your infrastructure now supports the next growth phase. The D4s_v5 (General Purpose)
    instance with 16GB RAM handles Medium Business (40-100 users), and you know exactly
    how to upgrade to larger instance types when user counts exceed current capacity.
    The automated backup system protects against data loss. The monitoring foundation
    provides visibility into system health. You built infrastructure that serves business
    needs for years, not months—that durability and control define digital sovereignty.
