  upgrade_steps:
  - step: Pre-Upgrade Assessment
    commands:
    - '# Check current Odoo version'
    - odoo-bin --version
    - '# List installed modules'
    - psql -d production_db -c "SELECT name FROM ir_module_module WHERE state='installed';"
    - '# Check custom module compatibility'
    - grep -r 'openerp.osv' custom-addons/
  - step: Backup Everything
    commands:
    - '# Full database backup'
    - pg_dump production_db > backup_pre_upgrade_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql
    - '# Backup filestore'
    - tar -czf filestore_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz ~/.local/share/Odoo/filestore/production_db
    - '# Backup custom addons'
    - tar -czf addons_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz /opt/odoo/custom-addons
  - step: Set Up Test Environment
    commands:
    - '# Create test database from backup'
    - createdb test_upgrade_db
    - psql test_upgrade_db < backup_pre_upgrade_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql
    - '# Clone Odoo {{target_version}} repository'
    - git clone https://github.com/odoo/odoo --depth 1 --branch {{target_version}}
      /opt/odoo-{{target_version}}
  - step: Run Upgrade on Test DB
    commands:
    - '# Update database schema'
    - /opt/odoo-{{target_version}}/odoo-bin -d test_upgrade_db -u all --stop-after-init
    - '# Check for errors in log'
    - tail -n 100 /var/log/odoo/odoo-server.log
  - step: Validate Test Environment
    tasks:
    - Test all critical business processes
    - Verify custom module functionality
    - Check report generation
    - Test integrations (payment gateways, shipping, etc.)
  - step: Production Upgrade
    commands:
    - '# Stop Odoo service'
    - sudo systemctl stop odoo
    - '# Switch to new version'
    - sudo -u odoo /opt/odoo-{{target_version}}/odoo-bin -d production_db -u all --stop-after-init
    - '# Start service'
    - sudo systemctl start odoo

  rollback_procedure:

  - 'Drop upgraded database: dropdb production_db'
  - 'Restore backup: psql -d production_db < backup_pre_upgrade_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql'
  - 'Restore filestore: tar -xzf filestore_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz -C ~/.local/share/Odoo/filestore/'
  - 'Start Odoo with old version: sudo systemctl start odoo'

  introduction: 'Migrating business operations from QuickBooks, Excel spreadsheets,
    NetSuite, or legacy ERP systems to Odoo requires production infrastructure ready
    before you begin data migration activities. Attempting to set up servers while
    simultaneously mapping data fields, validating import procedures, and training
    users guarantees timeline delays and increases the risk of errors that corrupt
    production data.


    The technical foundation you establish today determines whether your Odoo system
    scales smoothly from ten users to one hundred, or requires disruptive infrastructure
    rebuilds when you hit performance ceilings. Configuration decisions during deployment—PostgreSQL
    tuning, worker process calculations, NGINX timeout settings—either provide growth
    headroom or create bottlenecks that demand expensive remediation later.'
  upgrade_guide: ''
  conclusion: 'The Upgrade Odoo {{source_version}} to {{target_version}}: Complete
    2025 Guide architecture you implemented on {{ provider_name }} provides a scaling
    foundation that supports business growth without infrastructure rebuilds. The
    current {{ recommended_instance.instance_type }} configuration handles {{ recommended_instance.recommended_for
    }}, but the deployment patterns you followed—separated application and database
    tiers, reverse proxy SSL termination, automated backup systems—scale linearly
    when user counts increase.


    Growth-related infrastructure changes require minimal effort because you built
    on production-grade foundations from the start. Upgrading to a larger instance
    type takes thirty minutes and involves stopping services, resizing the instance
    through {{ provider_name }}''s console, adjusting PostgreSQL parameters for the
    new RAM allocation, and restarting services. Adding a read replica for reporting
    workloads requires similar effort. Implementing high availability with load-balanced
    application servers builds on the NGINX configuration you already deployed. You
    established architectural patterns that accommodate scaling without starting over.


    Your immediate focus should shift to operational excellence. Validate your backup
    restoration process by performing a complete recovery to a test instance. Establish
    monitoring baselines for normal CPU, memory, and disk usage patterns so you can
    identify anomalies before they cause outages. Document configuration decisions
    and administrative procedures for future team members. The infrastructure work
    is complete—operational maturity and application layer optimization represent
    your next leverage points for extracting maximum value from this {{ cost_estimate.monthly_total
    }} monthly infrastructure investment.

      Guide system runs production workloads within hours, but you won''t know about
      performance degradation, disk space exhaustion, or memory pressure until users
      report problems. Reactive troubleshooting during business hours costs more than
      proactive monitoring that catches issues overnight.


      Our **free Odoo Health Monitor script** tracks CPU, memory, disk usage, and
      PostgreSQL connections in real-time. The script runs every 5 minutes via cron,
      logging alerts before thresholds trigger user-visible problems.
