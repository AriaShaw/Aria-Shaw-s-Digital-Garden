  introduction: 'Migrating business operations from QuickBooks, Excel spreadsheets,
    NetSuite, or legacy ERP systems to Odoo requires production infrastructure ready
    before you begin data migration activities. Attempting to set up servers while
    simultaneously mapping data fields, validating import procedures, and training
    users guarantees timeline delays and increases the risk of errors that corrupt
    production data.


    The technical foundation you establish today determines whether your Odoo system
    scales smoothly from ten users to one hundred, or requires disruptive infrastructure
    rebuilds when you hit performance ceilings. Configuration decisions during deployment—PostgreSQL
    tuning, worker process calculations, NGINX timeout settings—either provide growth
    headroom or create bottlenecks that demand expensive remediation later.'
  upgrade_guide: 'Upgrading Odoo from version 17 to 7 requires careful planning and
    staging environment testing before touching production systems. Odoo version upgrades
    involve database schema changes, module API modifications, and potential breaking
    changes in custom code that demand thorough validation before go-live.


    The upgrade path from 17 to 7 represents a major version jump with significant
    framework changes. Odoo 18 introduces new UI patterns, modified ORM methods, and
    restructured standard modules. Database migration scripts transform your existing
    17 data structures into 7 format, but custom modules, third-party apps, and configuration
    customizations require manual review and adaptation.


    ## Pre-Upgrade Assessment and Planning


    Begin with comprehensive inventory of your current Odoo installation. Document
    all installed modules including custom developments and third-party apps from
    Odoo Apps Store. List any custom fields added through Odoo Studio, server actions,
    automated actions, and custom reports. This inventory identifies upgrade blockers—modules
    incompatible with 7 or customizations requiring code changes.


    Test the upgrade in a staging environment that mirrors production infrastructure.
    Clone your production database, create a separate server instance running Odoo
    7, and execute the upgrade process there first. Never upgrade production directly—even
    Odoo''s official upgrade service occasionally encounters edge cases that require
    troubleshooting.


    **Breaking Changes in Odoo 18:**


    - **ORM API changes**: Some model methods changed signatures or behavior. Custom
    code using `write()`, `create()`, or compute methods requires review.

    - **JavaScript framework**: Website and backend JavaScript underwent refactoring.
    Custom JS widgets need updates for new framework.

    - **View inheritance**: Some standard views restructured their XML, potentially
    breaking view xpath-based customizations.

    - **Removed modules**: Check if any installed modules were deprecated between
    v17 and v18 (consult release notes).


    ## Upgrade Execution Methods


    ### Method 1: Odoo Official Upgrade Service (Recommended for Standard Installations)


    Odoo provides a web-based upgrade service at upgrade.odoo.com that handles database
    migration automatically. Upload your database backup (without filestore for faster
    upload), select target version 7, and wait for processing. The service returns
    a migrated database typically within hours for small databases, potentially days
    for multi-GB databases with heavy customization.


    Advantages: Handles complex data migrations, tested against thousands of real-world
    databases, includes Odoo''s upgrade scripts for all standard modules. Limitations:
    Custom modules don''t migrate automatically, requires internet connection for
    upload/download, large databases face long processing times.


    ### Method 2: OpenUpgrade Open-Source Alternative


    OpenUpgrade project provides community-maintained upgrade scripts for migrating
    between Odoo versions. Clone the OpenUpgrade repository, checkout the 7 branch,
    install dependencies, and run migration against your database copy. OpenUpgrade
    follows Odoo''s upgrade patterns but adds migrations for community modules not
    covered by official service.


    Advantages: Free for all Odoo editions including Community, handles popular community
    modules, provides visibility into migration process. Limitations: Requires technical
    expertise, may lag behind Odoo official releases, limited support for custom modules.


    ### Method 3: Manual Module-by-Module Upgrade


    For heavily customized installations, manual upgrade provides maximum control.
    Install Odoo 7 in fresh environment, install modules one by one testing each,
    and migrate data through custom scripts using XML-RPC API or CSV import/export.
    This approach suits situations where custom code significantly deviates from standard
    Odoo.


    ## Post-Upgrade Validation and Testing


    After upgrade completion, systematic validation ensures business operations continue
    correctly:


    **Data Integrity Checks**: Run SQL queries comparing record counts before and
    after upgrade. Customer count, product count, open sales orders, invoice balances—these
    must match exactly. Discrepancies indicate migration errors requiring immediate
    investigation.


    **Business Process Testing**: Execute end-to-end workflows for critical operations:
    create sales order → deliver products → generate invoice → record payment. Test
    procurement workflows, manufacturing orders if using MRP, and financial period
    closing procedures. Upgraded systems sometimes exhibit subtle bugs that only appear
    during specific workflow combinations.


    **Custom Module Verification**: Custom modules require code review for API changes
    between versions. Common API changes between 17 and 18 include modified compute
    method decorators, changed field properties (like `tracking` behavior), and adjusted
    security rule evaluation. Review all Python files in custom modules for deprecation
    warnings. Test all custom functionality thoroughly—scheduled actions, automated
    actions, custom reports, API integrations with external systems.


    **User Acceptance Testing**: Involve power users from each department to validate
    their workflows function correctly. Accounting staff test month-end closing, inventory
    managers verify stock adjustments, sales team confirms quotation generation. Fresh
    perspective often catches issues technical testing misses.


    ## Rollback Planning and Go-Live Strategy


    Maintain ability to roll back to 17 if critical issues emerge post-upgrade. Keep
    the original production server untouched while running upgraded system in parallel.
    Configure parallel system with different domain name or port, allowing side-by-side
    comparison and gradual user migration.


    Schedule upgrade cutover during slow business period—weekend or holiday when transaction
    volume drops and you afford several hours maintenance window. Communicate upgrade
    schedule to all users days in advance, providing fallback procedures if urgent
    access needed during maintenance.


    Execute go-live with cutover checklist:


    1. Perform final production backup immediately before migration start

    2. Enable maintenance mode blocking user access during upgrade

    3. Execute upgrade procedure (official service, OpenUpgrade, or manual)

    4. Run automated validation queries checking data integrity

    5. Test critical business processes manually

    6. Enable user access and monitor for issues

    7. Maintain 17 system in read-only mode for 1 week as safety net


    ## Version-Specific Considerations for 7


    Odoo 18 introduces enhanced reporting capabilities, improved mobile responsiveness,
    and optimized database query patterns. After upgrading, explore new features like
    improved kanban views, enhanced search filters, and updated accounting features
    that may replace custom developments.


    Review Odoo 18 release notes for deprecated features. Any custom code relying
    on deprecated functions needs refactoring to use recommended replacements before
    support ends in future versions.


    The upgrade from 17 to 7 typically takes 4-8 weeks from initial assessment through
    production cutover for standard installations, potentially 12-16 weeks for complex
    customized systems. Allocate sufficient time for testing—rushing upgrades causes
    production issues that damage business operations and user confidence.

  conclusion: 'The Upgrade Odoo 1 to 7: Complete 2025 Guide architecture you implemented
    on {{ provider_name }} provides a scaling foundation that supports business growth
    without infrastructure rebuilds. The current {{ recommended_instance.instance_type
    }} configuration handles {{ recommended_instance.recommended_for }}, but the deployment
    patterns you followed—separated application and database tiers, reverse proxy
    SSL termination, automated backup systems—scale linearly when user counts increase.


    Growth-related infrastructure changes require minimal effort because you built
    on production-grade foundations from the start. Upgrading to a larger instance
    type takes thirty minutes and involves stopping services, resizing the instance
    through {{ provider_name }}''s console, adjusting PostgreSQL parameters for the
    new RAM allocation, and restarting services. Adding a read replica for reporting
    workloads requires similar effort. Implementing high availability with load-balanced
    application servers builds on the NGINX configuration you already deployed. You
    established architectural patterns that accommodate scaling without starting over.


    Your immediate focus should shift to operational excellence. Validate your backup
    restoration process by performing a complete recovery to a test instance. Establish
    monitoring baselines for normal CPU, memory, and disk usage patterns so you can
    identify anomalies before they cause outages. Document configuration decisions
    and administrative procedures for future team members. The infrastructure work
    is complete—operational maturity and application layer optimization represent
    your next leverage points for extracting maximum value from this {{ cost_estimate.monthly_total
    }} monthly infrastructure investment.
