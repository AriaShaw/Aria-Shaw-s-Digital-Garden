ai_generated_content:
  introduction: 'Shopify and Odoo structure business data differently—not just in
    database schema and table relationships, but in fundamental assumptions about
    how companies organize customers, products, transactions, and operational workflows.
    Where Shopify might combine shipping and billing addresses in single customer
    records, Odoo separates them into distinct contact types. Where Shopify tracks
    inventory with simple quantity fields, Odoo implements multi-location warehousing
    with stock moves and lot traceability. These aren''t simple field-to-field mappings—they''re
    conceptual transformations that require understanding both systems'' data models.


    The mapping complexity multiplies with customization. If your Shopify implementation
    includes custom fields, modified workflows, or integrated third-party applications,
    every customization becomes a migration decision point. Do you recreate the Shopify
    customization in Odoo, or redesign the workflow using Odoo''s native capabilities?
    Do you import custom field data into Odoo''s flexible field system, or archive
    it for reference while implementing cleaner data structures? Each decision affects
    migration scope, timeline, and the risk of data loss during transformation.


    This guide provides Migrate from Shopify to Odoo 18: E-commerce Integration Guide
    2025 field mapping templates that document the standard transformations between
    Shopify and Odoo data structures. You will map customer records including contact
    hierarchies and payment terms, transform product catalogs with variants and pricing
    rules, convert transaction histories with proper date handling and currency normalization,
    and migrate operational data like inventory locations and supplier relationships.
    The mapping phase alone requires 1-2 weeks, but produces documented transformations
    that survive system upgrades and serve as training material for staff learning
    Odoo''s data model.

    '
  conclusion: 'You now control a production Migrate from Shopify to Odoo 18: E-commerce
    Integration Guide 2025 infrastructure running on your cloud provider at $50-100
    monthly—approximately sixty to eighty percent less than equivalent managed Odoo
    hosting while retaining full administrative access, data ownership, and customization
    freedom. This deployment gives you digital sovereignty over your business operations
    without requiring enterprise cloud budgets or dedicated DevOps teams.


    The system you built follows production-grade architecture patterns used by businesses
    operating Odoo at scale. The PostgreSQL tuning, NGINX reverse proxy configuration,
    automated backup system, and SSL certificate management represent infrastructure
    decisions that managed hosting providers charge premium prices to abstract away.
    You implemented them directly in under ninety minutes, and you own the knowledge
    to maintain, troubleshoot, and scale this system as your business grows.


    Next steps focus on operational readiness. Test your backup restoration process
    within the next seventy-two hours while the deployment steps remain fresh. Configure
    monitoring alerts for CPU utilization, disk space, and PostgreSQL connection counts.
    Document your specific configuration decisions in a runbook that future administrators
    can follow. The infrastructure foundation you established today supports growth
    from ten users to one hundred without architectural rebuilds—that operational
    leverage justifies the deployment effort many times over.



    Don''t wait for users to report problems. Download the [Odoo health monitoring
    script](/downloads/odoo-health-monitoring-script/) to track CPU, memory, PostgreSQL
    performance, and response times with automated alerts when thresholds breach.'
  troubleshooting_guide: '## Common Issues and Solutions


    **Issue: Odoo service fails to start after installation**


    Check the service status and logs to identify the specific error. Run `systemctl
    status odoo` to see if systemd reports configuration file errors, permission problems,
    or missing dependencies. Most startup failures trace to incorrect paths in the
    configuration file—verify `/etc/odoo/odoo.conf` contains valid paths to the Odoo
    installation directory, addons folders, and log file location. Migration-specific
    startup failures often involve database schema incompatibilities. Check Odoo logs
    for "column does not exist" or "relation does not exist" errors—these indicate
    incomplete migration or incompatible module versions. Verify all custom modules
    are compatible with the target Odoo version. Disable custom modules temporarily
    to isolate whether they cause startup failures.


    **Issue: Database connection errors**


    Odoo cannot connect to PostgreSQL, typically showing "FATAL: password authentication
    failed" or "could not connect to server" errors. Verify PostgreSQL is running
    with `systemctl status postgresql`, confirm the Odoo database user exists with
    correct credentials, and check `pg_hba.conf` allows local connections. The Odoo
    configuration file''s `db_user`, `db_password`, and `db_host` parameters must
    match your PostgreSQL setup exactly—case sensitivity matters for usernames.


    **Issue: Port 8069 not accessible from browser**


    The firewall blocks incoming connections to Odoo''s default port. During migration,
    you may run both old and new Odoo instances simultaneously. Configure the new
    instance on a different port (e.g., 8070) to avoid conflicts, then update firewall
    rules to allow both ports during the parallel running period. After cutover completes,
    remove the old instance''s port from firewall rules. For production deployments
    behind NGINX reverse proxy, you should block external port 8069 access entirely
    and only expose ports 80/443, which NGINX proxies to Odoo''s localhost:8069.


    **Issue: Module installation fails with dependency errors**


    Odoo modules declare dependencies on other modules, and installation fails if
    dependencies are missing or if circular dependencies exist. Read the error message
    carefully—it specifies which module dependency is missing. Install missing modules
    through the Apps menu first, then retry the original module installation. For
    custom modules, verify the `__manifest__.py` file declares all dependencies in
    the `depends` list.


    **Issue: PDF generation produces blank or malformed documents**


    Migrated report templates may use deprecated QWeb syntax or reference removed
    fields. Test all report types (invoices, delivery orders, purchase orders) immediately
    after migration. Broken reports show XML parsing errors in logs. Recreate problematic
    reports using Odoo''s Studio or fix the QWeb templates in custom modules. Standard
    Odoo reports rarely break—issues typically come from customized templates.


    **Issue: Performance degradation with increasing users**


    Post-migration performance issues often trace to missing database indexes or outdated
    statistics. Run `REINDEX DATABASE` on your Odoo database after large data imports:
    `psql -d odoo_db -c ''REINDEX DATABASE odoo_db''`. Update PostgreSQL statistics
    with `VACUUM ANALYZE` to help the query planner choose efficient execution paths.
    Large migrations benefit from temporarily increasing PostgreSQL''s `maintenance_work_mem`
    for faster index building.


    **Issue: Backup or restore operations fail**


    Backup both source and target systems before cutover. Create a backup of the old
    system immediately before final data export, and backup the new Odoo instance
    after import but before user access begins. Store backups off-server—migration
    failures sometimes corrupt local storage. Verify backups are restorable by testing
    restoration on a separate server.


    **Issue: SSL certificate errors or mixed content warnings**


    Migrated systems may have hardcoded URLs in database records pointing to the old
    system. Search for old domain references in `ir.config_parameter` system settings
    and update to the new domain. Use SQL queries to find hardcoded URLs: `SELECT
    * FROM ir_attachment WHERE url LIKE ''%olddomain.com%''`. Update attachment URLs
    and regenerate reports that embed URLs.

  migration_guide: 'Migrating from Shopify to Odoo 18 requires production infrastructure
    ready before you begin data extraction and transformation activities. Attempting
    to export data, build import scripts, and configure the target system simultaneously
    guarantees timeline delays and increases the risk of errors that corrupt production
    data or require complete restarts.


    The migration follows a structured four-phase workflow that balances speed with
    risk mitigation. Phase one focuses on dependency mapping and data extraction.
    Phase two establishes the Odoo environment with equivalent functionality. Phase
    three handles data transformation and import validation. Phase four manages cutover
    procedures and parallel running verification.


    ## Phase 1: Preparation and Data Extraction (Week 1-2)


    Shopify''s Export functionality appears in multiple locations: Products > Export
    (CSV), Customers > Export (CSV), Orders > Export (CSV). Each export type provides
    different field sets—products include variants and metafields, customer exports
    contain marketing consent flags, order exports show fulfillment status and shipping
    details. For complete data extraction including historical order transactions
    and inventory adjustments, use Shopify''s Admin API or third-party export tools
    like Matrixify or Shopify Exporter.


    Document every Shopify feature your team currently uses because each one represents
    a capability you''ll need to replicate or replace in Odoo. Shopify collections
    become Odoo product categories and website publication rules. Shopify product
    variants (size, color) map to Odoo product attributes and variant generation.
    Shopify discount codes translate to Odoo''s coupon program module. Shopify''s
    fulfillment locations become Odoo warehouses or stock locations. Shopify metafields
    (custom data fields) require Odoo Studio to create equivalent custom fields on
    product or partner models.


    Export your complete dataset including master data (customers, products, vendors)
    and transactional history (sales orders, invoices, payments). Most migrations
    import 2-3 years of historical transactions for reporting continuity—older data
    can remain archived in Shopify for reference without loading into Odoo''s active
    database.


    ## Phase 2: Odoo Environment Setup (Week 2-3)


    Deploy Odoo 18 on production-grade infrastructure before attempting any data imports.
    The deployment guide earlier in this document establishes the technical foundation—PostgreSQL
    database, application server, backup systems, monitoring tools. Complete the entire
    deployment and verify system stability before proceeding to data import activities.


    Install the Odoo modules that match your Shopify functionality:


    - Sales module handles order processing and invoicing

    - Inventory module manages stock levels and multi-warehouse operations

    - Website + E-commerce modules provide storefront functionality

    - Shopify Connector module enables real-time order sync (hybrid approach)

    - Point of Sale module supports in-store retail operations


    Configure each module''s settings to match your business processes. Payment terms,
    tax rates, fiscal year definitions, currency handling, warehouse locations—these
    configurations must exist before importing transactional data that references
    them. Missing configurations cause import failures with cryptic error messages
    about missing foreign key relationships.


    ## Phase 3: Data Transformation and Import (Week 3-6)


    Shopify-specific data structures don''t directly map to Odoo''s data model. Shopify''s
    product variant system creates separate SKU for each size/color combination. Odoo
    uses template/variant architecture where one product template generates multiple
    product variants through attribute combinations. Rebuild Shopify''s variant structure
    by creating product attributes (Size, Color), defining attribute values (S/M/L,
    Red/Blue), and generating variants automatically. Shopify product collections
    can overlap (one product in multiple collections) while Odoo categories traditionally
    have single parent—use website publication rules or product tags for flexible
    categorization.


    The transformation process converts Shopify exports into Odoo-compatible CSV files
    or XML-RPC API calls. Start with master data in this specific order:


    1. **Chart of Accounts and Tax Definitions**: Financial configuration must exist
    before importing transactions that reference account codes and tax rates. Export
    Shopify''s chart of accounts, map to Odoo''s account.account structure, and import
    via CSV through Accounting module.


    2. **Customers and Vendors (Partners)**: Shopify''s customer and vendor records
    become res.partner entries in Odoo. Map contact information, billing/shipping
    addresses, payment terms, and credit limits. Handle Shopify customers include
    one default address plus multiple shipping addresses from order history. Import
    default address as main partner address, create separate child contact records
    for frequently used shipping addresses. Shopify''s customer tags become partner
    tags in Odoo for segmentation and marketing campaigns.


    3. **Products and Services**: Export product catalog from Shopify with SKUs, descriptions,
    pricing, and cost data. Map to Odoo''s product.product and product.template models,
    handling Shopify stores product images on Shopify''s CDN with URLs like cdn.shopify.com/s/files/...
    These URLs remain accessible after migration but depend on your Shopify store
    staying active. Best practice: download all product images during export, upload
    to Odoo''s filestore, and update product image fields. Handle Shopify metafields
    by creating custom fields through Odoo Studio—common metafields like shipping_weight,
    material, or care_instructions need manual field creation before import.


    4. **Transactional History**: Import sales orders, invoices, and payments chronologically
    starting from your cutoff date (typically 2-3 years prior). Shopify orders include
    both paid and unpaid statuses. Import paid orders as confirmed sale.order records
    with associated invoices and payments. Unpaid or pending orders import as quotations
    in draft state. Shopify''s order fulfillment status maps to Odoo''s delivery order
    state (waiting, partially available, done). Historical orders older than 2 years
    can import as invoices only (skip sale.order creation) for cleaner data and faster
    imports.


    Test imports extensively in a staging environment. Create a full copy of your
    production Odoo instance, import a small data subset (10-20 records per type),
    and verify all relationships and calculations work correctly. Fix mapping errors
    in your transformation scripts, then import progressively larger datasets until
    you''ve validated the complete process.


    ## Phase 4: Cutover and Parallel Running (Week 6-8)


    The migration cutover requires careful timing to minimize business disruption.
    Schedule go-live for a weekend or slow business period when you can afford several
    hours of downtime for final data synchronization and validation.


    Execute the cutover in this sequence:


    1. **Final Shopify backup**: Perform a complete backup of Shopify immediately
    before starting cutover procedures. This backup serves as your rollback point
    if critical issues emerge.


    2. **Delta synchronization**: Import all Shopify transactions created since your
    last test import. Your transformation scripts should handle incremental imports,
    updating existing records and creating new ones without duplication.


    3. **Data validation checks**: Run comprehensive validation queries comparing
    Shopify totals to Odoo totals. Customer count, product count, outstanding invoice
    balances, accounts receivable aging—these must match exactly. Discrepancies indicate
    import errors that require immediate correction.


    4. **User training and access provisioning**: Create Odoo user accounts for all
    staff members with appropriate security groups and access rights. Conduct brief
    training sessions covering navigation, transaction entry, and report generation
    for their specific roles.


    5. **Parallel running period**: Operate both Shopify and Odoo simultaneously for
    1-2 weeks. Enter new transactions in Odoo while maintaining Shopify read-only
    access for reference. This parallel period builds confidence and identifies gaps
    in Odoo configuration or training.


    6. **Shopify decommissioning**: After successful parallel running validates Odoo
    handles all business operations correctly, decommission Shopify. Cancel any subscriptions,
    export final reports for archival, and establish read-only access for historical
    data queries.


    ## Common Migration Pitfalls and Solutions


    **Challenge**: Shopify apps that add custom functionality (subscriptions, product
    bundles, reviews).

    **Solution**: Evaluate Odoo equivalents for each Shopify app. Recurring orders
    become Odoo subscription module, product bundles use Bills of Materials, reviews
    use website product reviews. Some apps have no direct Odoo equivalent—assess business
    impact before migration.


    **Challenge**: Maintaining Shopify storefront while using Odoo for backend operations
    (hybrid approach).

    **Solution**: Install Shopify Connector module for real-time order sync. Configure
    webhook-based synchronization so Shopify orders create Odoo sale orders automatically.
    Inventory updates in Odoo sync back to Shopify to prevent overselling. This hybrid
    approach lets you keep Shopify''s established SEO and marketing while using Odoo''s
    superior inventory and accounting.


    **Underestimating data cleanup effort**: Shopify accumulates years of inconsistent
    data entry—duplicate customer records, products with incorrect categories, transactions
    with missing information. Plan to spend 30-40% of migration time cleaning source
    data before import. Bad data imported into Odoo multiplies cleanup effort tenfold.


    **Inadequate testing of edge cases**: Your transformation scripts handle common
    scenarios correctly but fail on edge cases like products without SKUs, customers
    with only shipping addresses (no billing), or voided invoices. Test your import
    process with the full dataset, not samples, to expose these issues before go-live.


    **Insufficient user training**: Power users with years of Shopify experience struggle
    with Odoo''s different workflows and terminology. Budget for comprehensive training
    and provide job aids documenting common tasks in Odoo terms. Plan for productivity
    dips during the first 2-4 weeks post-migration.


    **Missing validation procedures**: Without systematic validation, you discover
    missing data or incorrect mappings weeks after go-live when reconstruction becomes
    impossible. Create validation checklists comparing Shopify reports to Odoo equivalents:
    customer aging reports, inventory valuation, profit & loss statements.
