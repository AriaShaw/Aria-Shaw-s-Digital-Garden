ai_generated_content:
  introduction: 'your cloud provider''s standard tier instance instance delivers the
    compute and memory resources that Odoo 18 requires for production deployments
    serving 10-25 users. The 4 dedicated vCPUs handle concurrent user requests without
    CPU steal, while 8GB RAM provides sufficient headroom for PostgreSQL query caching.


    Performance under load separates viable production infrastructure from systems
    that collapse during month-end financial closes or customer deadline pressure.
    The specific instance configuration in this guide delivers predictable response
    times even when users simultaneously run complex inventory calculations, generate
    financial statements, and process bulk sales orders.'
  migration_guide: 'The Shopify to Odoo migration follows a four-phase workflow that
    balances speed with risk mitigation. Phase one is pure data extraction. Export
    your complete product catalog with all variants, customer database including order
    history, and at least two years of transactional data for reporting continuity.
    Document every Shopify app you currently use because each one represents a capability
    you''ll need to replicate or replace in Odoo. Klaviyo becomes Odoo Email Marketing.
    ShipStation gets replaced by Odoo Inventory with shipping connectors. Yotpo reviews
    migrate to Odoo''s built-in product review system. This inventory of dependencies
    prevents you from discovering critical missing functionality after you''ve already
    committed to the migration.


    Phase two focuses on Odoo environment setup. Install the Sales, Inventory, and
    Website modules as your foundation. Configure payment gateways before you import
    any products because Odoo''s checkout flow depends on having at least one active
    payment method. Set up shipping method mappings to match your current Shopify
    zones and rates. Now import products with their images, making sure Shopify''s
    variant structure translates correctly to Odoo''s product attributes system. A
    Shopify product with three colors and two sizes becomes an Odoo product template
    with two attributes generating six product variants. Get this mapping wrong and
    you''ll spend weeks manually correcting inventory levels.


    Phase three introduces the Shopify Connector module, which determines whether
    you''re running full replacement or hybrid mode. In hybrid mode, the connector
    enables real-time order sync from Shopify to Odoo, inventory sync from Odoo back
    to Shopify, and bi-directional product catalog synchronization. You''ll generate
    Shopify Admin API credentials, configure the connector in Odoo''s settings panel,
    map your existing products to prevent duplicate creation, and enable webhook-based
    auto-sync for near-instantaneous updates. Test this extensively in sandbox mode
    because a misconfigured sync can oversell inventory or create duplicate orders
    that confuse your fulfillment team.


    Phase four is go-live, and it''s more about monitoring than configuration. Enable
    live order sync and personally review the first fifty orders to verify they''re
    flowing correctly with accurate customer data, correct product mappings, and proper
    inventory deductions. Adjust your inventory sync frequency based on how quickly
    your stock levels change. High-velocity SKUs might need sync every fifteen minutes
    while slow-movers can update hourly. The most common failure point is Shopify''s
    metafields, which are custom data fields that don''t automatically map to Odoo.
    You''ll need Odoo Studio to create matching custom fields and write mapping rules
    to preserve this data during migration.

    '
  conclusion: 'You achieved practical digital sovereignty by deploying Migrate from
    Shopify to Odoo 18: E-commerce Integration Guide 2025 on infrastructure you control
    at $50-100 monthly. This system eliminates dependency on managed Odoo hosting
    providers who lock you into proprietary platforms, restrict customization freedom,
    and increase prices arbitrarily because they control your data and operational
    access. You own your Odoo instance, your PostgreSQL database, your backup strategy,
    and your ability to migrate to different infrastructure providers if business
    requirements or pricing changes.


    The sovereignty advantage compounds over time. Your Odoo data exports to standard
    PostgreSQL dump files that restore on any compatible infrastructure—your cloud
    provider, competing cloud providers, or on-premises hardware. Your configuration
    exists in documented scripts and files you can version control and replicate.
    Your operational knowledge transfers across infrastructure platforms because you
    understand the underlying components rather than provider-specific management
    interfaces. This portability and knowledge ownership protect against vendor lock-in
    and preserve your ability to optimize costs as your business evolves.


    Maintain this sovereignty by documenting your deployment, testing your backups
    quarterly, and staying current with security updates. The infrastructure you built
    today serves business needs for years while remaining under your control—that
    combination of longevity, ownership, and cost efficiency justifies the deployment
    effort and establishes the operational foundation your business deserves.



    Production security requires defense-in-depth. Access our [security hardening
    toolkit](/downloads/security-hardening-toolkit/) with automated audit scripts,
    intrusion detection setup, and CIS benchmark implementation for Ubuntu and Debian
    systems.'
