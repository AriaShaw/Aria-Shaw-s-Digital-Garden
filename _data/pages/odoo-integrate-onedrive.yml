  main_content: '## Integration Architecture and Data Flow


    The OneDrive-Odoo integration relies on a server-to-server communication model
    using the Microsoft Graph API as its foundation. Odoo acts as the central orchestrator,
    initiating all data exchange operations. Your Odoo instance does not host a passive
    endpoint; it proactively polls OneDrive for changes and pushes updates based on
    business events within the ERP. This architecture prevents the sync delays common
    in client-side integrations and ensures Odoo maintains authority over the document
    lifecycle.


    ### Microsoft Graph API as the Communication Bridge


    Microsoft Graph serves as the exclusive gateway to your OneDrive and SharePoint
    data. The integration uses specific Graph endpoints: `/v1.0/me/drive` for personal
    OneDrive accounts and `/v1.0/drives/{drive-id}` for structured SharePoint document
    libraries. Every file operation—upload, download, or metadata update—transforms
    into an HTTP request to this API. The Graph API provides a unified interface,
    which simplifies the code required to interact with diverse Microsoft 365 storage
    locations.


    ### Odoo Module with Asynchronous Queue Processing


    A custom Odoo module forms the integration''s engine. This module leverages Odoo''s
    built-in queueing system to manage all external API calls. When a user attaches
    a file to an Odoo record, the module does not block the user interface with a
    direct call to OneDrive. Instead, it creates a queue job that handles the file
    upload in the background. This design preserves system responsiveness and provides
    automatic retry mechanisms for failed operations, a critical feature for production
    resilience.


    ### Bi-Directional Synchronization Triggers


    The data flow operates in two directions, triggered by specific events. The primary
    flow originates in Odoo. Creating an invoice, a sales order, or a project task
    with an attachment triggers an immediate sync job to a pre-defined OneDrive folder
    structure. The secondary, poll-based flow checks OneDrive for new or modified
    files. A scheduled Odoo job runs every few minutes, executing a Delta Query against
    the Graph API to identify changes and pull them into the corresponding Odoo records,
    ensuring no document modification goes unnoticed.


    ### Authentication Token Management Layer


    A dedicated component within the Odoo module manages the OAuth 2.0 access tokens.
    This layer handles the entire token lifecycle. It acquires the initial token using
    the admin-provided client secret, stores it securely in Odoo''s encrypted parameters,
    and automatically refreshes it before expiration. This process ensures the integration
    maintains a persistent, authenticated connection to Microsoft Graph without requiring
    manual intervention after the initial setup.


    ## Step-by-Step Configuration


    ### Azure Active Directory App Registration


    Begin the configuration in the Azure Portal. Navigate to Azure Active Directory
    and select "App registrations." Click "New registration" and provide a distinct
    name, such as "Odoo-18-OneDrive-Integration." Select "Accounts in any organizational
    directory" for a multi-tenant application or a more restrictive option based on
    your security policy. Do not set a redirect URI at this stage. After registration,
    Azure presents the essential "Application (client) ID" and "Directory (tenant)
    ID." Record these values; they form the core of your integration credentials.


    Next, generate a client secret. Navigate to the "Certificates & secrets" section
    for your new app. Click "New client secret," provide a description, and select
    an expiration period. A 12-month expiration provides a balance between security
    and maintenance overhead. Azure displays the secret''s value once. Copy this string
    immediately and store it in a secure location; you cannot retrieve it again. Losing
    it requires creating a new secret. Finally, configure the API permissions. Navigate
    to the "API permissions" section and add a new permission for Microsoft Graph.
    Select "Delegated permissions" and grant `Files.ReadWrite.All` and `User.Read`
    scopes. These permissions authorize the application to read and write all files
    in the user''s drive and access basic user profile information.


    ### Odoo Module Structure and Core Files


    Create a new Odoo module named `onedrive_integration`. The module requires a standard
    structure with key files. The `__manifest__.py` file declares the module''s dependencies
    and data files. It must include `''web''` and `''queue_job''` as dependencies.
    The `models/` directory houses the core logic. Create `__init__.py` and `onedrive_sync.py`
    files. The `models/onedrive_sync.py` file contains the main integration models.
    The `views/` directory holds the user interface components, specifically `res_config_settings_views.xml`
    for the configuration panel.


    ### System Parameter Configuration in Odoo


    Activate developer mode in your Odoo instance. Navigate to Settings > Technical
    > Parameters > System Parameters. Create new parameters to store your Azure credentials
    securely. Add `onedrive.client_id` with your Application ID and `onedrive.client_secret`
    with the client secret value. Odoo encrypts these parameters in the database.
    Create `onedrive.tenant_id` with your Directory ID. This method separates sensitive
    credentials from your application code, which follows security best practices
    for deployment across environments.


    ### Authentication Flow Implementation


    The module must implement the OAuth 2.0 device authorization grant flow. This
    flow suits server-side applications that lack a browser interface. Create a method
    in your `onedrive.sync` model that initiates the authentication process. The method
    sends a POST request to `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant_id}/oauth2/v2.0/devicecode`
    with the client_id as a parameter. The response contains a `device_code` and a
    `verification_uri` with a `user_code`.


    Your Odoo module should present the `verification_uri` and `user_code` to the
    administrator through a configuration wizard. The user visits the URI, enters
    the code, and consents to the requested permissions. Meanwhile, the module polls
    the Microsoft token endpoint at `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant_id}/oauth2/v2.0/token`
    with the `device_code` until authentication succeeds. The final response provides
    an `access_token` and a `refresh_token`, which the module stores in the system
    parameters.


    ### Scheduled Job and Synchronization Logic


    Define the synchronization logic within the `onedrive.sync` model. Create a method
    named `sync_onedrive_changes` that uses the Delta Query feature of the Graph API.
    The initial call to `/v1.0/me/drive/root/delta` fetches all items and returns
    a `@odata.deltaLink`. The module stores this delta link. Subsequent sync jobs
    use this stored link to retrieve only the items that have changed since the last
    poll, which optimizes performance and reduces API quota consumption.


    Configure the scheduled action. In your module''s `__manifest__.py`, define an
    ir.cron record. Set the interval to 5 or 10 minutes based on your business requirements
    for document freshness. This cron job calls the `sync_onedrive_changes` method.
    For the Odoo-to-OneDrive push synchronization, override the `write` and `create`
    methods on the `ir.attachment` model. Use the `onchange` decorator or a custom
    method to enqueue a job to the `queue.job` system whenever a new attachment links
    to a business document like a sale.order or account.invoice.


    ### Common Configuration Pitfalls


    A frequent error involves incorrect API permission scopes. Using `Application`
    permissions instead of `Delegated` permissions causes authentication failures
    unless the app has admin consent. Another pitfall is mishandling the token refresh
    cycle. The access token expires every hour. Your code must catch `401 Unauthorized`
    errors and automatically use the refresh token to acquire a new access token without
    user interaction. Failing to implement this logic breaks the integration after
    the first token expiration.


    Ensure your module handles the initial delta link correctly. The first Delta Query
    returns the entire drive contents. Your code must process this large dataset without
    timing out. Implement pagination by checking the `@odata.nextLink` in the response
    and making subsequent requests until you receive the final delta link. Neglecting
    pagination results in a partial sync that misses files.


    ## Data Mapping and Transformation


    ### Document Metadata Mapping Strategy


    The integration must map metadata fields between Odoo''s `ir.attachment` model
    and OneDrive''s file properties. The `ir.attachment` record contains a `name`
    (filename), `datas` (file content), `res_model` (linked model), and `res_id` (linked
    record ID). OneDrive stores a `name`, `id`, `lastModifiedDateTime`, and `webUrl`.
    The core mapping involves synchronizing the `name` and content. The `res_model`
    and `res_id` have no direct equivalents in OneDrive, which presents a mapping
    challenge.


    To maintain the relationship between a file and its Odoo record, the integration
    uses a custom property on the OneDrive file. When the module uploads a file, it
    sets an extended property on the OneDrive item using the PATCH method on the `/v1.0/me/drive/items/{item-id}`
    endpoint. The request body includes `{ "oproo_res_model": "sale.order", "oproo_res_id":
    15042 }`. This metadata persists with the file. During a sync from OneDrive, the
    module reads these properties to determine the correct Odoo record for attachment.


    ### Folder Structure and Organizational Logic


    A defined folder structure in OneDrive organizes synchronized files and prevents
    a chaotic root directory. The integration creates a root folder named "Odoo Sync"
    and then structures subfolders by Odoo model and record ID. A typical path resembles
    `Odoo Sync/sale.order/15042/`. This structure mirrors the relational data model
    of Odoo. The module constructs this path dynamically when pushing a file from
    Odoo. It uses the `res_model` and `res_id` to build the target folder path.


    When syncing a new file from OneDrive, the module must deduce the target Odoo
    model and record. It first checks the file''s custom `oproo_res_model` and `oproo_res_id`
    properties. If these properties exist, the attachment links to that specific record.
    If the properties are absent, the integration uses the file''s location within
    the folder structure. A file located in the `/sale.order/15042/` folder attaches
    to that sales order. This dual approach ensures robustness for both pre-linked
    and new files.


    ### File Format and Size Handling


    Odoo stores file content in its database as a base64-encoded string in the `datas`
    field. OneDrive accepts the raw binary content for uploads. The transformation
    requires the module to decode the base64 data from Odoo before sending a binary
    PUT request to the OneDrive `/content` endpoint. For downloads, the process reverses;
    the module reads the binary stream from the Graph API and base64-encodes it for
    storage in Odoo''s `datas` field.


    Large files present a performance challenge. The base64 encoding process increases
    the data size by approximately 33%. Uploading a 100MB file requires Odoo to process
    and transmit over 133MB of data. The integration must handle this efficiently.
    For files exceeding a defined threshold (e.g., 50MB), the module should use OneDrive''s
    upload session API, which supports resumable uploads in chunks. This prevents
    timeouts and provides a better experience for large video files or database backups.


    ### Conflict Resolution and Version Control


    A conflict arises when both Odoo and OneDrive versions of the same file change
    between sync cycles. The integration needs a deterministic conflict resolution
    strategy. A common approach is a "last write wins" policy based on the `lastModifiedDateTime`
    timestamp from OneDrive compared to the `write_date` on the `ir.attachment` record.
    The integration should log all conflicts for administrator review rather than
    silently overwriting data.


    The module can leverage OneDrive''s built-in versioning for important documents.
    When updating a file, the integration can use a specific API call to create a
    new version instead of overwriting the current one. This provides an audit trail
    of document changes. The Odoo attachment interface can then display a link to
    the version history in OneDrive, giving users powerful version control directly
    from their ERP.


    ## Error Handling and Resilience


    ### Microsoft Graph API Error Responses


    The integration will encounter various HTTP status codes from the Graph API. A
    `401 Unauthorized` error signals an expired or invalid access token. The error
    handler must catch this, use the stored refresh token to obtain a new access token,
    and then retry the original request. A `403 Forbidden` error often indicates insufficient
    permissions; the app registration may lack the `Files.ReadWrite.All` scope, or
    the authenticated user may not have access to the target drive.


    A `429 Too Many Requests` response means the application has exceeded the Graph
    API rate limits. The response headers include a `Retry-After` value indicating
    the number of seconds to wait before retrying. Your code must parse this header
    and implement a backoff strategy, potentially re-queuing the job with a delay.
    A `503 Service Unavailable` error requires a similar retry-with-backoff approach.
    Continuous `5xx` errors may indicate a broader Microsoft service outage.


    ### Network and Connectivity Failures


    Unstable network connections between your Odoo server and the Microsoft Graph
    endpoints can cause random timeouts or connection resets. All HTTP requests must
    implement a try-except block with a configurable timeout parameter. The `requests`
    library in Python allows you to set a timeout for both connection and read operations.
    When a timeout occurs, the job should fail and retry according to the Odoo queue
    job''s built-in retry policy, which typically includes exponential backoff.


    ### Data Integrity and Validation Errors


    Data corruption can occur during file transfer. The integration should implement
    a checksum verification for critical files. After a download from OneDrive, the
    module can calculate the MD5 or SHA-1 hash of the received binary data and compare
    it to the `file.hash` object provided by the Graph API for the source file. A
    mismatch indicates a corrupted transfer and should trigger an automatic retry.
    For uploads, a similar process verifies the data reached OneDrive intact.


    Validation errors arise from unsupported file names or paths. OneDrive restricts
    certain characters in file names, such as `" * : < > ? / \ |`. The integration
    must sanitize file names from Odoo before attempting an upload. A preprocessing
    function should replace or remove these invalid characters. Similarly, the module
    must handle path length limitations by truncating overly long folder or file names
    that exceed the 400-character path limit in OneDrive.


    ### Recovery Procedures and Manual Intervention


    Despite robust error handling, some situations require manual intervention. The
    module should provide a "Reset Sync State" function for administrators. This function
    clears the stored delta link and forces a full resynchronization on the next scheduled
    job. This action resolves issues where the delta link becomes corrupted or out
    of sync with the actual state of the OneDrive, a condition that can cause files
    to disappear from the Odoo sync.


    For persistent attachment records that fail to sync, the module should log detailed
    error information in a dedicated model, `onedrive.sync.error`. This allows an
    administrator to view a list of failures, diagnose the root cause (e.g., "Target
    folder not found," "Permission denied"), and trigger individual retries. This
    granular control prevents a single problematic file from blocking the synchronization
    of all subsequent files in the queue.


    ## Testing and Validation


    ### Authentication and Authorization Test Suite


    Begin validation by testing the complete OAuth 2.0 flow. Execute the device code
    generation and complete the user consent process in a browser. Verify that the
    module successfully obtains an access token and refresh token and stores them
    in the system parameters. Then, test the token refresh logic. You can simulate
    an expired token by manually deleting the access token parameter or waiting for
    its natural expiration. Confirm the module automatically uses the refresh token
    to acquire a new access token without administrative action.


    Test the application permissions by attempting to access files outside the authenticated
    user''s scope. The integration should handle `403 Forbidden` errors gracefully,
    logging the incident without crashing. Verify that the configured Azure AD app
    has the correct `Delegated` permissions and that an administrator granted consent.
    Testing this scope ensures the integration operates with the principle of least
    privilege.


    ### Data Synchronization Test Scenarios


    Create a comprehensive test plan that covers all data flow directions. For Odoo-to-OneDrive
    sync, create a new attachment on an Odoo record, such as a quotation. Validate
    that the file appears in the correct `/sale.order/{id}/` folder in OneDrive within
    the expected poll interval. Update the file in Odoo and confirm the changes propagate
    to OneDrive, creating a new version if configured. Delete the attachment in Odoo
    and verify the corresponding file moves to the OneDrive recycle bin or is deleted
    permanently based on your configuration.


    For OneDrive-to-Odoo sync, perform the reverse operations. Upload a new file directly
    to a model-specific folder in OneDrive. Check that the scheduled job detects the
    file and creates a new `ir.attachment` record linked to the correct Odoo model
    and ID. Modify the file in OneDrive and confirm Odoo reflects the updated content.
    Move a file between two model folders in OneDrive and verify Odoo detaches it
    from the first record and attaches it to the second. This tests the folder-based
    mapping logic.


    ### Performance and Load Testing


    Assess the integration''s behavior under load. Upload 100+ files of varying sizes
    (1KB to 100MB) to Odoo in a short period. Monitor the Odoo queue jobs to ensure
    they process without overwhelming the server or hitting Graph API rate limits.
    Measure the time from attachment creation to file appearance in OneDrive. This
    test identifies bottlenecks in the job queue or network throughput.


    Execute a similar load test from the OneDrive side. Use PowerShell or the Graph
    API to bulk-upload many files to the Odoo sync folder structure. Then, trigger
    the sync job and measure the time required for Odoo to import all attachments.
    Monitor Odoo''s server resources (CPU, RAM) during this process to ensure the
    sync does not degrade performance for other users. These tests establish performance
    baselines for your specific hardware and network configuration.


    ### Failure Simulation and Recovery Validation


    A robust test plan intentionally introduces failures. Temporarily block outbound
    HTTPS traffic from your Odoo server to `graph.microsoft.com` to simulate a network
    partition. Observe how the queued jobs fail and then retry once network connectivity
    restores. This validates the resilience of the queue job system.


    Force specific Graph API errors. You can simulate a `429 Too Many Requests` response
    by writing a script that makes rapid, repeated calls to the Graph API, exhausting
    your quota. Verify that the integration respects the `Retry-After` header and
    does not exacerbate the problem. Test the conflict resolution mechanism by manually
    modifying the same file in both systems simultaneously. Confirm that the "last
    write wins" policy (or your chosen strategy) executes predictably and logs the
    event.


    ## Security Considerations


    ### OAuth 2.0 and Credential Management


    The integration''s security foundation rests on the OAuth 2.0 protocol. Never
    embed client secrets or refresh tokens directly in your module''s code. The step-by-step
    configuration uses Odoo''s System Parameters for secure storage because this data
    is encrypted at rest in the database. Restrict access to these parameters to administrators
    only. The client secret, in particular, represents a critical credential; treat
    its compromise with the same severity as a password breach.


    The principle of least privilege governs the Azure app permissions. The `Files.ReadWrite.All`
    scope is powerful; it grants read and write access to all files the authenticated
    user can access. In a high-security environment, consider if a more restrictive
    scope like `Files.ReadWrite` (for only the app-owned files) could suffice, though
    this is often incompatible with accessing user-designated folders. Regularly audit
    the consented permissions in your Azure AD portal to ensure they remain aligned
    with business needs.


    ### Data Encryption in Transit and at Rest


    All communication between Odoo and the Microsoft Graph API must use TLS 1.2 or
    higher. The `requests` library in Python defaults to verifying SSL certificates,
    which you should never disable. This ensures all data, including file content
    and authentication tokens, is encrypted during transmission. On the Odoo side,
    file attachments stored in the `ir.attachment` model''s `datas` field (base64)
    reside within your database. Ensure your database infrastructure and Odoo backups
    employ encryption at rest to protect this data.


    ### Access Control and Audit Logging


    The integration inherits Odoo''s record-level security. A user can only access
    a OneDrive-synced file in Odoo if they have read permissions on the related record
    (e.g., the sales order or invoice). The module does not bypass Odoo''s native
    access control lists (ACLs). However, remember that the Azure app authenticates
    as a specific user. Any file that user can access in OneDrive becomes potentially
    syncable to Odoo. Therefore, the service account user in Microsoft 365 should
    have minimal, role-specific access to OneDrive folders.


    Implement detailed audit logging within the sync module. Log key events: authentication
    token refresh, file upload initiation, file download completion, and synchronization
    errors. Record the Odoo user ID, the related record, the OneDrive item ID, and
    a timestamp for each operation. These logs are invaluable for security incident
    response, allowing you to trace the movement of a specific document through the
    integration pipeline and identify any unauthorized access or exfiltration attempts.


    ## Performance Optimization


    ### API Quota Management and Call Efficiency


    The Microsoft Graph API enforces strict rate limits per tenant and per application.
    Your integration must minimize API calls to avoid throttling. The single most
    important optimization is the consistent use of the Delta Query for polling OneDrive
    changes. A full folder scan using `list children` would be prohibitively expensive,
    while the delta link returns only modifications. Furthermore, batch API requests
    can combine multiple operations into a single HTTP call. For instance, if you
    need to update the custom properties for several files, you can use the `$batch`
    endpoint to send one request with multiple inner operations.


    Implement intelligent polling intervals. A 5-minute interval provides near-real-time
    sync but consumes more API quota. For many business processes, a 15 or 30-minute
    interval is sufficient and reduces your API call volume by 66-83%. You can even
    implement a dynamic interval that increases during periods of low activity and
    shortens when the system detects frequent changes. This approach balances responsiveness
    with resource conservation.


    ### File Chunking and Stream Handling


    Large file transfers can block worker threads and consume excessive memory. Instead
    of loading a 1GB file from the database into memory, base64-decoding it, and then
    sending it, use a streaming approach. The `requests` library supports streaming
    uploads when you provide a file-like object. You can create a stream that reads
    from the database and decodes base64 in chunks, feeding the data directly to the
    HTTP request without holding the entire file in RAM.


    For very large files (over 100MB), leverage the OneDrive Upload Session. This
    API breaks the upload into smaller chunks (e.g., 5-10MB). The integration can
    upload these chunks sequentially or in parallel. This technique prevents timeouts,
    allows pausing and resuming transfers, and provides a more reliable experience
    for large media files or database archives. The module should automatically switch
    to an upload session for files exceeding a configurable size threshold.


    ### Caching Strategies for Metadata


    Repeatedly fetching the same file or folder metadata from the Graph API wastes
    cycles and quota. Implement a lightweight caching layer for immutable or slow-changing
    data. For example, once the module resolves a folder path to a OneDrive folder
    ID, it can cache this mapping for a short period (e.g., 10 minutes). This prevents
    the need to traverse the folder hierarchy for every new file upload to the same
    location.


    Cache the user''s drive ID and other static profile information obtained from
    the ` /v1.0/me/drive` endpoint. There is no need to request this information before
    every sync operation. Fetch it once during the initial configuration and then
    only refresh it if an API call fails with an error indicating the drive is no
    longer available. This simple caching of fundamental identifiers can eliminate
    a significant number of redundant API calls over time.


    ### Queue Job Prioritization and Concurrency


    Not all sync jobs are equal. A job to sync a small PDF contract has a different
    priority than a job to sync a 2GB video file. Configure multiple Odoo queue channels
    with different capacities and priorities. Route small, metadata-heavy jobs to
    a high-priority channel with many concurrent workers. Route large file transfer
    jobs to a low-priority channel with fewer workers to prevent them from monopolizing
    system resources. This ensures the system remains responsive for critical business
    documents even during a bulk transfer of large files.'
  conclusion: 'Completing this OneDrive to Odoo 18 integration establishes a unified
    document management framework that eliminates manual processes and data silos.
    Your sales team now attaches contracts directly in Odoo with the confidence that
    a secure, versioned copy exists in OneDrive. Your accountants can audit invoice
    trails without switching between applications. This technical achievement translates
    into direct operational gains: your team reclaims hours previously lost to manual
    file management, and your business reduces the compliance risks inherent in disconnected
    systems. The integration delivers a seamless user experience that masks the underlying
    complexity of the data synchronization.


    The strategic value extends beyond immediate time savings. You have built a flexible
    data bridge that can evolve with your business. The architecture supports extending
    the integration to SharePoint Online, connecting entire team sites and departmental
    libraries to your Odoo operations. You can enhance the logic to apply specific
    retention policies based on document type or automate complex approval workflows
    that span both platforms. This foundation empowers you to innovate, using the
    combined power of Odoo''s business logic and Microsoft''s cloud storage ecosystem
    to create competitive advantages.


    Your immediate next step involves monitoring the integration''s health in a production
    environment. Watch the Odoo job queue for failed tasks and review the sync error
    logs for the first few days. Conduct a user training session to demonstrate the
    new attachment workflow and explain the folder structure in OneDrive. Measure
    the success of this project by tracking key metrics: the reduction in support
    tickets related to missing documents, the decrease in average time to locate a
    client file, and the increase in user adoption of the centralized Odoo document
    interface.


    This integration represents more than a technical connection; it represents a
    fundamental shift toward a cohesive digital workplace. You have broken down the
    barriers between your core business platform and your cloud storage, creating
    a fluid information system. The data now flows to where your team works, empowering
    them with immediate access to the documents they need within the context of their
    daily tasks. This project demonstrates that the true power of modern SaaS platforms
    lies not in their individual capabilities, but in their intelligent integration.'
