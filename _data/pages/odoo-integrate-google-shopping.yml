  introduction: 'You stare at your Google Merchant Center dashboard, then at your
    Odoo 18 product list. The numbers do not match. Your stock levels in Odoo show
    forty-two units, but Google Shopping displays only nineteen. A customer orders
    the last "available" item, triggering a cascade of fulfillment delays and a negative
    review. Your team spends hours each week downloading Google product data, manually
    updating Odoo sales orders, and correcting inventory discrepancies. This manual
    process drains resources, introduces human error, and prevents your ecommerce
    operation from scaling. Your advertising spend suffers because your product feeds
    contain outdated prices or inaccurate availability data.


    This guide provides a complete technical blueprint for a robust, bidirectional
    integration between Google Shopping and Odoo 18. You will learn how to construct
    a real-time data pipeline that synchronizes product information, inventory levels,
    and order data. We will cover the entire process, from initial architecture design
    and API configuration to complex data mapping and production deployment. The integration
    eliminates manual data entry, ensures absolute data consistency across platforms,
    and automates your entire sales workflow. I will show you how to configure the
    Odoo Connector framework, establish secure OAuth 2.0 authentication with Google
    APIs, and implement resilient error-handling routines. You will master the data
    transformation logic required to map Odoo''s product model to the complex Google
    Shopping Content API schema. We will also tackle advanced performance optimization,
    ensuring your sync processes handle thousands of SKUs without impacting your Odoo
    server''s performance. Prepare for a deep technical dive that demands a solid
    understanding of Odoo module development and Python. The implementation requires
    several days of focused work, but the result delivers a fully automated, enterprise-grade
    commerce engine.'
  main_content: "## Integration Architecture and Data Flow\n\nA robust integration\
    \ between Google Shopping and Odoo 18 requires a clear, event-driven architecture.\
    \ The system must handle bidirectional data flow, reacting to changes in both\
    \ platforms. You will build this on top of Odoo's built-in Connector framework,\
    \ which provides the foundational queues and jobs for managing synchronous and\
    \ asynchronous tasks. The core components include a custom Odoo module, the Google\
    \ Shopping Content API, and a dedicated synchronization engine. Your design must\
    \ account for real-time triggers for critical events like stock updates and batched\
    \ processing for less time-sensitive product data feeds.\n\nThe primary data flow\
    \ originates from Odoo to Google Merchant Center. When a product's quantity or\
    \ price changes in Odoo, an Odoo ORM trigger fires. This trigger creates a job\
    \ in the Connector queue, which a dedicated job runner processes. The job runner\
    \ fetches the product data, transforms it from the Odoo product model into the\
    \ Google Shopping product schema, and pushes the update via the Content API. This\
    \ ensures your shopping ads always reflect accurate, real-time information. For\
    \ high-volume stores, you implement a delta-sync mechanism, transmitting only\
    \ the fields that changed instead of the entire product record.\n\nThe reverse\
    \ data flow handles order synchronization from Google Shopping to Odoo. A Google\
    \ Pub/Sub topic, configured in your Google Cloud project, receives notifications\
    \ for new orders. Your Odoo module exposes a webhook endpoint that receives these\
    \ Pub/Sub messages. Upon receiving a notification, the endpoint authenticates\
    \ the request, fetches the complete order details from the Content API, and creates\
    \ a new sale order in Odoo. This process automatically creates the customer record\
    \ if it does not exist and reserves inventory from your stock. The architecture\
    \ treats Odoo as the system of record, ensuring all commerce data centralizes\
    \ in your ERP.\n\nYou must design the data flow with idempotency and resilience.\
    \ Every API call to Google must include idempotency keys to prevent duplicate\
    \ product inserts or order creation from retry attempts. The Connector framework\
    \ handles job retries for transient failures, but your code must manage hard failures,\
    \ such as data validation errors from Google, by logging them for administrative\
    \ review. This event-driven, queue-based pattern decouples the systems, preventing\
    \ a slowdown in one platform from crippling the other.\n\n## Step-by-Step Configuration\n\nBegin by creating a new Odoo module to host your integration logic. Define\
    \ the module's manifest file with dependencies on the `connector`, `sale`, and\
    \ `stock` Odoo applications. Your module needs new models for storing Google Merchant\
    \ account configurations and a model to extend the standard Odoo product template\
    \ with Google-specific fields. Create a `google_merchant_account` model that stores\
    \ credentials like `merchant_id`, `auth_token`, and the `pubsub_topic` name. This\
    \ model serves as the central configuration point for connecting to each of your\
    \ Merchant Center accounts.\n\n### Configure Google Cloud Project and API Access\n\
    \n    Navigate to the Google Cloud Console and create a new project or select an existing\
    \ one. Enable the \"Shopping Content API\" for this project. Under \"APIs & Services\
    \ > Credentials,\" create a new OAuth 2.0 Client ID. Configure the OAuth consent\
    \ screen and set the application type to \"Web application.\" You must add your\
    \ Odoo server's URL to the authorized redirect URIs, typically `https://your-odoo-server.com/auth_oauth/signin`.\
    \ Save the generated `client_id` and `client_secret`; you will need them for the\
    \ Odoo configuration. Finally, create a Service Account and download its JSON\
    \ key file for server-to-server authentication, which is more secure for background\
    \ sync jobs.\n\n### Implement OAuth 2.0 Authentication in Odoo\n\nOdoo's `auth_oauth`\
    \ module provides the foundation for OAuth flows. Extend it to support Google.\
    \ Add a record to the `ir.config_parameter` model storing the client ID and secret.\
    \ You must create a controller that handles the OAuth callback. This controller\
    \ exchanges the authorization code for an access token and refresh token, which\
    \ it then saves securely in the `google_merchant_account` record.\n\n```python\n\
    from odoo import http\nfrom odoo.adds.auth_oauth.models.ir_http import OAuthLogin\n\
    \nclass GoogleOAuthController(http.Controller):\n    @http.route('/google_shopping/auth/callback',\
    \ type='http', auth='public')\n    def google_oauth_callback(self, **kw):\n  \
    \      code = kw.get('code')\n        # Use the code to get tokens from Google\n\
    \        access_token, refresh_token = self._get_google_tokens(code)\n       \
    \ # Store tokens in the configured account record\n        account = http.request.env['google.merchant.account'].search([],\
    \ limit=1)\n        account.write({\n            'access_token': access_token,\n\
    \            'refresh_token': refresh_token,\n        })\n        return \"Authentication\
    \ Successful. You can close this window.\"\n```\n\n### Set Up Product Sync Infrastructure\n\
    \n    Define a \"synchronizer\" class using the Odoo Connector framework. This class\
    \ encapsulates the logic for exporting a product to Google. Create a new backend\
    \ model, `google.shopping.backend`, which links to your `google_merchant_account`.\
    \ Then, create the synchronizer that inherits from `connector.backend`.\n\n```python\n\
    from odoo.adds.connector.components.mapper import mapping\nfrom odoo.adds.connector.backend\
    \ import backend\n\nclass GoogleProductSynchronizer(backend.Backend):\n    _name\
    \ = 'google.shopping.synchronizer'\n    _backend_type = 'google_shopping'\n  \
    \  _model_name = 'product.product'\n\n    @mapping\n    def map_offer_id(self,\
    \ record):\n        # Map Odoo product ID to Google's offerId\n        return\
    \ {'offerId': record.default_code}\n\n    @mapping\n    def map_title_and_price(self,\
    \ record):\n        # Map name and price to Google's schema\n        return {\n\
    \            'title': record.name,\n            'price': {\n                'value':\
    \ record.list_price,\n                'currency': record.currency_id.name\n  \
    \          }\n        }\n```\n\n### Configure Order Import Webhook\n\nIn your Google\
    \ Merchant Center, navigate to Settings > API Configuration. Provide your Odoo\
    \ server's webhook URL, which you will create in the next step. Odoo needs a controller\
    \ to receive the Pub/Sub messages that Google sends when a new order arrives.\n\
    \n```python\nimport json\nfrom odoo import http\n\nclass GoogleShoppingOrderWebhook(http.Controller):\n\
    \    @http.route('/google_shopping/order/notification', type='json', auth='public',\
    \ methods=['POST'], csrf=False)\n    def order_notification(self):\n        request_data\
    \ = json.loads(http.request.httprequest.data)\n        # Verify the message authenticity\
    \ (omitted for brevity)\n        message_data = json.loads(base64.b64decode(request_data['message']['data']))\n\
    \        order_id = message_data.get('orderId')\n        # Create a connector\
    \ job to import the order\n        self._import_order_job.delay(order_id)\n  \
    \      return ''\n```\n\n### Common Configuration Pitfalls\n\nA frequent error involves\
    \ incorrect timezone configuration. Google APIs require UTC timestamps, while\
    \ Odoo uses the company's timezone. Always convert datetime objects to UTC before\
    \ sending them to Google. Another pitfall concerns the OAuth scope; you must request\
    \ the full `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/content` scope for your integration\
    \ to have the necessary permissions to manage products and orders. Failure to\
    \ implement a robust token refresh mechanism will cause your syncs to fail silently\
    \ once the initial access token expires. Your code must check for token expiration\
    \ before each API call and automatically use the refresh token to obtain a new\
    \ access token.\n\n## Data Mapping and Transformation\n\nThe core challenge of\
    \ this integration lies in translating Odoo's internal product data structure\
    \ into the precise schema demanded by the Google Shopping Content API. Odoo's\
    \ `product.product` and `product.template` models contain your source data, but\
    \ Google's `product` resource has over fifty required and optional attributes.\
    \ You must construct a meticulous mapping strategy that covers every field, from\
    \ basic identifiers to complex tax and shipping information.\n\n### Core Identifier\
    \ and Title Mapping\n\nThe `offerId` field in Google must map to a unique, stable\
    \ identifier in Odoo. Never use the Odoo product `id` because it can change during\
    \ database migrations. Use the product's `default_code` (SKU) for the `offerId`.\
    \ The product `name` in Odoo maps directly to Google's `title` field. However,\
    \ you must ensure the title meets Google's character limits and does not contain\
    \ promotional text like \"free shipping.\" The `description` field requires a\
    \ similar transformation, often needing a sanitized version of the Odoo product\
    \ description with HTML tags stripped out.\n\n### Price and Availability Mapping\n\
    \n    Google's price structure is an object containing `value` and `currency`. Map the\
    \ Odoo `list_price` to `price.value` and the company currency to `price.currency`.\
    \ For availability, you must convert Odoo's stock state to Google's predefined\
    \ values. Implement logic that checks the `qty_available` against the `sale_ok`\
    \ and `available_threshold` fields.\n\n```python\n@mapping\ndef map_availability(self,\
    \ record):\n    # Check if product is sellable and in stock\n    if not record.sale_ok:\n\
    \        return {'availability': 'out of stock'}\n    qty_available = record.qty_available\
    \ - record.outgoing_qty\n    if qty_available > 0:\n        return {'availability':\
    \ 'in stock'}\n    else:\n        return {'availability': 'out of stock'}\n```\n\
    \n### Category and Attribute Handling\n\nGoogle uses the Google Product Category\
    \ (GPC) taxonomy, a numerical system completely different from Odoo's product\
    \ categories. You cannot map these automatically. You must extend your Odoo product\
    \ category model to include a field for the corresponding GPC code. Your mapping\
    \ function then reads this value. For product attributes like size or color, you\
    \ map Odoo's attribute values to Google's `size`, `color`, and `material` fields.\
    \ This requires a configuration table in Odoo that links Odoo attribute lines\
    \ to the correct Google schema field.\n\n### Image Link and Additional Data\n\
    \n    The `image_link` field must point to a publicly accessible URL of the product's\
    \ image. Odoo typically stores images as binary data. Your integration must generate\
    \ a permanent, absolute URL for each product's primary image. You can achieve\
    \ this by implementing a controller in Odoo that serves the images or, for better\
    \ performance, by pushing the images to a CDN and storing the CDN URL in a dedicated\
    \ field for the sync. Complex products require mapping for `shippingWeight` and\
    \ `shippingLength` from Odoo's `product_dimension` fields, converting the units\
    \ to the standard required by Google (e.g., weight in pounds).\n\n## Error Handling\
    \ and Resilience\n\nThe integration will encounter errors. Your design must anticipate\
    \ common failure modes and handle them gracefully without manual intervention.\
    \ Categorize errors into transient network issues, data validation errors from\
    \ Google, and authentication failures. The Odoo Connector framework provides a\
    \ built-in retry mechanism for jobs, which you should configure for transient\
    \ errors like `5xx` HTTP status codes from Google or temporary network timeouts.\n\
    \n### Common Google API Error Codes\n\nThe Google Content API returns specific error\
    \ codes that dictate your response. A `401 Unauthorized` error signals an expired\
    \ or invalid access token. Your error handler must catch this, automatically use\
    \ the refresh token to obtain new credentials, and retry the job. A `429 Too Many\
    \ Requests` error indicates rate limiting. Your code must catch this, parse the\
    \ `Retry-After` header, and re-queue the job with the appropriate delay. For `400\
    \ Bad Request` errors, the API response body contains a detailed reason, such\
    \ as `invalidValue` for a field or `missingAttribute`.\n\n### Implementing a Dead\
    \ Letter Queue\n\nNot all errors can resolve with a retry. Data validation errors,\
    \ like an invalid GPC code or a missing required field, will persist until you\
    \ fix the underlying data in Odoo. For these, implement a dead letter queue. When\
    \ a job fails permanently, log the error message, the product ID, and the failed\
    \ operation to a dedicated `google.sync.error` model. This creates a clear dashboard\
    \ for administrators to see and rectify data problems without sifting through\
    \ server logs.\n\n### Idempotency and Duplicate Prevention\n\nThe Google APIs are\
    \ idempotent when you provide a unique `idempotencyKey` with your requests. Generate\
    \ this key for every insert or update operation. A good pattern combines the Odoo\
    \ product ID, the timestamp of the last update, and the operation type. This ensures\
    \ that if a network failure causes your code to retry a request, Google will recognize\
    \ the duplicate and ignore it instead of creating two product entries.\n\n```python\n\
    def _generate_idempotency_key(self, record, operation):\n    timestamp = record.write_date\
    \ or record.create_date\n    return f\"{record.id}_{timestamp.timestamp()}_{operation}\"\
    \n\ndef _call_google_api(self, endpoint, data, operation):\n    idempotency_key\
    \ = self._generate_idempotency_key(data['record'], operation)\n    headers = {\n\
    \        'Content-Type': 'application/json',\n        'Idempotency-Key': idempotency_key\n\
    \    }\n    # ... make the API request ...\n```\n\n### Order Import Error Scenarios\n\
    \n    Order import failures can have immediate business impact. If the webhook fails\
    \ to create an Odoo sale order, it must log a critical error and, if possible,\
    \ send an alert to the sales team. Common issues include missing customer information\
    \ in the Google order data or a product in the order that does not exist in Odoo.\
    \ Your code must handle these partial failures, perhaps by creating a draft order\
    \ that flags the missing information for manual completion.\n\n## Testing and\
    \ Validation\n\nBefore deploying the integration to production, you must execute\
    \ a rigorous testing protocol. Start with unit tests for your data mapping functions.\
    \ Create test methods that feed known Odoo product records into your mappers and\
    \ assert that the output matches the expected Google product JSON structure. Mock\
    \ the Google API calls to test the synchronization logic without needing a live\
    \ internet connection.\n\n### End-to-End Testing with a Sandbox\n\nGoogle provides\
    \ a Merchant Center sandbox environment for development and testing. Create a\
    \ sandbox account and configure your Odoo test instance to connect to it. Execute\
    \ a full product sync for a small subset of your catalog. Verify that the products\
    \ appear in the sandbox Merchant Center dashboard with the correct titles, prices,\
    \ and images. Then, simulate a test order through the Google Sandbox Orders API.\
    \ Monitor your Odoo instance to confirm the sale order creates automatically with\
    \ the correct line items and customer details.\n\n### Data Validation Checklist\n\
    \n    Create a pre-flight checklist to run before the first full product sync. This\
    \ checklist should verify that all required fields in Odoo have valid data for\
    \ the Google mapping. Key validations include: every product has a `default_code`\
    \ (SKU), every product category has a valid Google Product Category code, all\
    \ product images are accessible via a public URL, and product weights and dimensions\
    \ populate for items that require them. Automate these checks with a script that\
    \ reports any products failing validation.\n\n### Performance and Load Testing\n\
    \n    A integration that works for ten products might fail for ten thousand. Test the\
    \ synchronization performance with a large volume of data. Use Odoo's built-in\
    \ performance profiler to monitor the execution time of your connector jobs. Pay\
    \ close attention to the number of SQL queries your mapping functions generate;\
    \ an N+1 query problem can cripple performance. For high-volume stores, test the\
    \ impact of simultaneous stock updates—if a flash sale updates the inventory of\
    \ one hundred products at once, can your queue system handle the surge of one\
    \ hundred sync jobs without slowing down the Odoo server?\n\n### Webhook and Order\
    \ Flow Verification\n\nTesting the order import flow presents a unique challenge\
    \ because you cannot easily generate real Google Pub/Sub messages. Instead, create\
    \ a utility function in Odoo that mimics the exact JSON payload structure that\
    \ Google sends. Use this to trigger your webhook endpoint directly from the Odoo\
    \ interface. Verify that the entire process—from receiving the notification to\
    \ creating the confirmed sale order—completes without error. Test edge cases,\
    \ such as an order for a product that has since been deactivated in Odoo.\n\n\
    ## Security Considerations\n\nThis integration handles sensitive business data,\
    \ including product catalogs, pricing, and customer orders. You must secure every\
    \ data transfer and storage point. All communication with Google APIs must use\
    \ HTTPS with TLS 1.2 or higher. Never use HTTP for any endpoint, especially the\
    \ webhook that receives order notifications.\n\n### OAuth 2.0 and Token Management\n\
    \n    Store the OAuth `client_secret` and `refresh_token` in Odoo with the highest security.\
    \ Use Odoo's `ir.config_parameter` model with its built-in encryption for sensitive\
    \ fields. Never log these tokens to log files or display them in the user interface.\
    \ Implement an automatic token refresh mechanism. Access tokens expire after a\
    \ short period. Your code must detect a `401` error and use the stored refresh\
    \ token to obtain a new access token without any administrator intervention.\n\
    \n### Webhook Security and Validation\n\nAn open webhook endpoint presents a severe\
    \ security risk. You must validate that every incoming webhook request originates\
    \ from Google. Google signs the Pub/Sub messages it sends. Your webhook controller\
    \ must verify this signature using the public keys provided by Google. Reject\
    \ any request that fails signature verification. This prevents malicious actors\
    \ from injecting fake orders into your system.\n\n```python\nfrom google.auth\
    \ import jwt\n\nclass GoogleShoppingOrderWebhook(http.Controller):\n    def _verify_message(self,\
    \ message):\n        # Extract the JWT token from the 'Authorization' header\n\
    \        token = http.request.httprequest.headers.get('Authorization').split('\
    \ ')[1]\n        # Verify the token using Google's public certs\n        decoded\
    \ = jwt.decode(token, certs=GOOGLE_PUBLIC_CERTS)\n        return decoded\n```\n\
    \n### Data Access and Permissions\n\nWithin Odoo, restrict access to the Google\
    \ Merchant Account configuration models to only authorized users, such as system\
    \ administrators. Apply Odoo's record rules to ensure users can only see the sync\
    \ logs and error reports relevant to their operational purview. The service account\
    \ you use for server-to-server authentication should have the principle of least\
    \ privilege, granted only the \"Content Manager\" role in Google Merchant Center,\
    \ not owner-level permissions.\n\n## Performance Optimization\n\nA poorly optimized\
    \ integration can consume excessive server resources and slow down your entire\
    \ Odoo instance. The primary bottleneck is usually the volume of API calls to\
    \ Google, followed by database read/write operations in Odoo during the mapping\
    \ process. Identify and mitigate these bottlenecks with a combination of batching,\
    \ caching, and efficient querying.\n\n### API Call Batching and Quotas\n\nThe Google\
    \ Shopping Content API supports batch operations. Instead of sending one HTTP\
    \ request per product, you can bundle up to 1000 product operations in a single\
    \ batch request. This reduces network overhead and speeds up the sync process\
    \ dramatically. Implement a batch scheduler in your connector jobs that groups\
    \ pending product updates into batches of the maximum allowed size. Monitor your\
    \ API usage against Google's quota limits to avoid being throttled. Spread large\
    \ sync operations over time to stay within the per-minute quota.\n\n### Efficient\
    \ Odoo ORM Querying\n\nA common performance anti-pattern in Odoo is searching\
    \ and reading records in a loop. When your mapper processes a batch of products,\
    \ pre-fetch all the necessary related data in a single query. Use `read_group`\
    \ for aggregate data and `prefetch` fields to minimize the number of database\
    \ queries. For example, if you need stock quantities for a batch of products,\
    \ query the stock quant model once for the entire batch instead of calling `product.qty_available`\
    \ for each individual product.\n\n### Implementing a Caching Layer\n\nProduct data\
    \ like category names or attribute values does not change often. Implement a simple\
    \ caching layer for this semi-static data. Store the mapped values for Google\
    \ Product Categories in a dictionary in memory, so you do not have to read the\
    \ corresponding Odoo record for every single product. Use Odoo's `tools.cache`\
    \ decorator to cache the results of expensive functions that compute shipping\
    \ dimensions or tax categories.\n\n### Queue Management and Job Chunking\n\nThe\
    \ Odoo Connector queue can become overwhelmed if you create a separate job for\
    \ every product update during a mass import. Instead, create chunked jobs. A single\
    \ job should handle the synchronization of 100 or 500 products. This reduces the\
    \ queue management overhead and allows for more efficient batch processing. Monitor\
    \ your queue with the Odoo Job Queue manager and scale the number of job runners\
    \ according to your sync load. For a high-traffic store, you might need to run\
    \ multiple job runner processes to keep up with the update frequency."
  conclusion: 'You now possess the complete technical blueprint to construct a robust,
    bidirectional bridge between Google Shopping and Odoo 18. This integration eliminates
    the manual data entry that plagues so many ecommerce operations, replacing it
    with a seamless, automated data flow. Your product feeds will maintain perfect
    accuracy, your stock levels will synchronize in real-time, and new orders will
    flow directly into your Odoo sales pipeline without any human intervention. The
    architecture we detailed ensures resilience against network failures and data
    errors, while the performance optimizations guarantee your Odoo instance remains
    responsive even under heavy load.


    Begin your implementation by setting up the Google Cloud project and configuring
    the OAuth 2.0 credentials. This foundational step grants your Odoo instance the
    secure access it needs to communicate with the Google APIs. Next, build the core
    synchronizer module, focusing first on the product export mapping. Test this data
    flow thoroughly in a sandbox environment with a small set of products before attempting
    a full catalog sync. Pay particular attention to the data validation checklist
    to preemptively catch mapping errors for attributes like product categories and
    shipping dimensions.


    The strategic value of this integration extends far beyond time savings. You gain
    a unified commerce platform where Odoo serves as the single source of truth. This
    consolidation allows for sophisticated reporting and analytics, giving you a clear
    view of your entire operation from advertising spend to inventory turnover. You
    can now run promotions with confidence, knowing your pricing and stock levels
    remain consistent across all channels. The automated order import process accelerates
    your fulfillment cycle, which can directly improve customer satisfaction and lead
    to better seller ratings on Google.


    Move forward with the confidence that you are building a mission-critical system.
    The initial investment in development and testing will pay continuous dividends
    in operational efficiency, data accuracy, and business scalability. You have transformed
    a fragmented, error-prone process into a cohesive, automated engine for growth.
    This integration is not just a technical project; it is a fundamental upgrade
    to your commerce infrastructure that positions your business to capitalize on
    opportunities without being hamstrung by manual processes. Your team can now focus
    on strategy and growth, not on copying data between systems.'
