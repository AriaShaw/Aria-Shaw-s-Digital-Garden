  main_content: '## Integration Architecture and Data Flow


    ### Core Integration Patterns


    Amazon SES integrates with Odoo 18 through two primary architectural patterns:
    SMTP relay and API direct integration. The SMTP method leverages Odoo''s native
    outgoing mail server configuration, acting as a straightforward relay for all
    outgoing messages. This approach requires minimal code modification but offers
    limited control over advanced SES features like templates and analytics. The API
    integration method replaces Odoo''s default mail delivery mechanism with direct
    Python calls to the SES API, enabling full utilization of SES capabilities including
    template management, configuration sets, and detailed delivery metrics.


    The API integration architecture introduces a custom Odoo mail delivery module
    that intercepts outgoing messages before they enter the standard mail queue. This
    module transforms Odoo''s internal message format into SES API requests, handling
    attachments, HTML content, and recipient management. The integration maintains
    Odoo''s existing email composition interface while redirecting delivery through
    AWS. This approach preserves user experience while leveraging SES''s superior
    infrastructure for actual message transmission.


    ### Data Flow Sequence


    Outgoing email flow begins when a user sends a message through any Odoo module—sales
    quotations from CRM, invoice notifications from accounting, or marketing campaigns
    from mass mailing. The Odoo mail module processes the message, applies any template
    formatting, and routes it to the outgoing mail queue. Our custom SES integration
    intercepts messages at this point, converting them to SES-compatible format with
    proper headers, MIME encoding, and attachment processing.


    For incoming bounce and complaint processing, Amazon SES sends notifications to
    an SNS topic configured in your AWS account. The Odoo integration includes an
    SNS webhook endpoint that receives these notifications, processes them, and updates
    corresponding Odoo records. Bounce handling automatically disables email sending
    to invalid addresses, while complaint processing handles abuse reports to protect
    your sending reputation. This bidirectional data flow ensures comprehensive email
    management within your Odoo environment.


    ### System Components Integration


    The complete architecture incorporates multiple AWS services beyond SES. IAM roles
    manage secure access between Odoo and AWS, while SNS handles event notifications
    for bounces and complaints. CloudWatch provides monitoring and logging for troubleshooting
    delivery issues. Within Odoo, the integration spans core mail modules, the CRM
    for lead communication tracking, and marketing automation for campaign performance
    analytics. This multi-service approach creates a robust email ecosystem rather
    than a simple mail relay replacement.


    ## Step-by-Step Configuration


    ### AWS Infrastructure Setup


    Begin with AWS SES service verification in your target region. Navigate to the
    SES console and verify your domain using DNS TXT records for authentication. This
    domain verification establishes your authority to send emails from your business
    domain through SES. Complete the verification process before proceeding to ensure
    all test emails originate from a validated source. For production systems, request
    SES production access by submitting a use case description and initial volume
    projections to AWS.


    Configure IAM policies with precise permissions for Odoo SES access. Create a
    dedicated IAM user with programmatic access keys rather than using root credentials.
    Apply the AmazonSESFullAccess managed policy initially, then refine permissions
    for production security. The minimal policy should include ses:SendRawEmail, ses:SendEmail,
    and ses:GetSendStatistics actions restricted to your verified domains. Implement
    strict resource constraints to prevent credential misuse if keys become exposed.


    Create SNS topics for bounce and complaint notifications. Configure these topics
    to receive feedback events from SES and connect them to Lambda functions or direct
    HTTP endpoints. The SNS configuration requires proper access policies that permit
    SES service to publish messages. Test the notification flow using the SNS console
    before integrating with Odoo to verify the entire AWS-side infrastructure operates
    correctly.


    ### Odoo Outgoing Mail Configuration


    Install the base Odoo mail modules if not already active, including ''mass_mailing''
    and ''mail'' core applications. Navigate to Settings > Technical > Outgoing Mail
    Servers and create a new SMTP server record. Enter your SES SMTP endpoint specific
    to your AWS region—for example, email-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com for the US
    East region. Use TLS encryption on port 587 with your IAM user SMTP credentials,
    which differ from your console access keys.


    Configure the outgoing mail server parameters with your verified SES domain as
    the default FROM address. Set the server priority to ensure it handles all outgoing
    mail rather than Odoo''s default sendmail configuration. Test the connection using
    the built-in test feature with a validated recipient address. This initial SMTP
    configuration provides basic sending capability while we develop the full API
    integration for advanced features.


    ### Custom SES Module Development


    Create a new Odoo module with Python dependencies for boto3 and requests. Implement
    a custom mail delivery method that inherits from IrMailServer and overrides the
    send_email method. This custom method intercepts outgoing messages and redirects
    them through the SES API instead of standard SMTP. The module requires proper
    dependency declaration in the __manifest__.py file and model registration in the
    __init__.py structure.


    Develop the core sending function using boto3 SES client initialization with AWS
    credentials stored in Odoo parameters. The function constructs SES SendRawEmail
    requests from Odoo message objects, handling encoding for HTML content, text alternatives,
    and file attachments. Implement proper error handling for SES API responses, converting
    AWS exceptions to Odoo-compatible error messages for user notification.


    Create configuration settings within Odoo''s general settings interface for AWS
    access key management, default configuration sets, and sending rate limits. Store
    sensitive credentials using Odoo''s parameter encryption rather than plaintext
    in the database. This configuration interface allows administrators to manage
    SES settings without code modification after deployment.


    ### Advanced Feature Implementation


    Implement SES template support for Odoo''s mass mailing campaigns. Create a synchronization
    function that maps Odoo email templates to SES templates, maintaining version
    control when templates update. Develop template rendering logic that merges Odoo
    record data with SES template variables, handling the different syntax conventions
    between the systems.


    Configure custom configuration sets for different email types—transactional versus
    marketing messages. Apply appropriate configuration sets based on the Odoo module
    originating the email, enabling detailed analytics tracking per email category.
    Implement open and click tracking through SES configuration sets, with webhook
    endpoints that capture these events and update Odoo mailing statistics.


    Set up bounce processing with automatic recipient list management. Create methods
    that parse SNS bounce notifications and disable email sending to problematic addresses
    within Odoo. Implement complaint handling that immediately suspends sending to
    recipients who report spam, protecting your sender reputation. Connect these processing
    functions to your SNS webhook endpoint with proper signature verification for
    security.


    ## Data Mapping and Transformation


    ### Email Message Structure Conversion


    Odoo''s internal message representation requires significant transformation to
    match SES API requirements. The Odoo mail.message object contains HTML body content,
    subject headers, and recipient lists in a single structure, while SES expects
    separate parameters for each component. Our transformation logic extracts these
    elements and constructs a MIME-compliant email message with proper content-type
    headers for multipart alternative messages.


    Address formatting presents a particular challenge in the mapping process. Odoo
    supports display names with email addresses in "Name <email@domain.com>" format,
    while SES requires RFC-complient address encoding. Our transformation function
    parses Odoo''s address format, extracts the email component for SES delivery,
    and preserves the display name in the MIME headers. This ensures recipient inboxes
    show familiar names rather than raw email addresses.


    Attachment handling requires MIME encoding conversion. Odoo stores attachments
    as binary fields in the database with associated filenames and MIME types. The
    transformation process encodes these binaries as base64 MIME parts with appropriate
    content-disposition headers. For large attachments, we implement streaming encoding
    to prevent memory overload during message construction for bulk email operations.


    ### Template Variable Mapping


    SES template system uses a different variable syntax than Odoo''s QWeb templates.
    Odoo''s ${object.field_name} format must transform to SES''s {{variableName}}
    convention. Our mapping function identifies Odoo template variables and converts
    them to SES-compatible placeholders while maintaining the data context from Odoo
    records. This enables seamless template migration between the systems without
    manual variable rewriting.


    We handle complex data types like dates, currencies, and related records through
    preprocessing before template rendering. Odoo''s ORM returns Python objects for
    related fields, while SES templates expect simple strings or numbers. Our transformation
    logic flattens these relationships into simple values, formats dates according
    to locale settings, and converts currencies to formatted strings with appropriate
    symbols.


    Multi-language template support requires maintaining parallel template versions
    in Odoo and SES. We implement a synchronization mechanism that tracks template
    changes in Odoo and updates corresponding SES templates in all configured languages.
    This ensures marketing campaigns maintain consistent design and variable structure
    across language versions while leveraging SES''s template rendering performance.


    ### Bounce Notification Processing


    Amazon SNS delivers bounce notifications in JSON format with complex nested structures.
    Our mapping logic extracts the critical information—recipient email address, bounce
    type, and timestamp—then converts this to Odoo''s bounce tracking model. We categorize
    bounces as transient or permanent based on the SES bounce subtype, applying different
    handling rules for each category.


    The transformation process updates multiple Odoo models from a single bounce notification.
    For mass mailing recipients, we update the mailing.contact bounce counter and
    disable future sending if thresholds exceed limits. For individual messages, we
    log the bounce in the message tracking history and trigger alert notifications
    to system administrators for investigation of delivery problems.


    Complaint notifications require immediate action to protect sender reputation.
    Our mapping logic identifies complaint events and applies more aggressive suppression
    than standard bounces. We create blacklist entries that prevent any future communication
    with complaining recipients across all Odoo modules, not just the originating
    campaign or message type.


    ## Error Handling and Resilience


    ### Common SES Integration Errors


    SES quota exceptions occur when your sending limits exceed allocated throughput.
    Odoo''s default behavior retries failed messages, creating sending loops that
    exacerbate quota problems. Our error handling implements exponential backoff with
    jitter, gradually increasing retry delays while distributing load across the rate
    limit window. We track sending volumes against known SES limits and preemptively
    queue messages when approaching thresholds.


    Authentication failures typically stem from expired IAM credentials or incorrect
    region configuration. Our error detection differentiates between temporary token
    failures and permanent configuration issues. Temporary authentication problems
    trigger credential refresh procedures, while configuration errors generate administrator
    alerts with specific remediation guidance. We implement credential validation
    during system startup and at regular intervals to catch problems before they impact
    email delivery.


    Message formatting errors arise from invalid email addresses, encoding problems,
    or oversized attachments. Our preprocessing validates recipient addresses against
    RFC standards before attempting SES delivery, rejecting malformed addresses with
    detailed error messages. We detect character encoding conflicts and normalize
    content to UTF-8, preventing delivery failures from special characters in subject
    lines or body content.


    ### System Resilience Strategies


    Implement circuit breaker patterns for SES API interactions. When error rates
    exceed configured thresholds, the system temporarily fails fast rather than attempting
    doomed requests. This prevents cascading failures during AWS service disruptions
    while conserving system resources for recovery. The circuit breaker monitors error
    patterns and automatically restores normal operation when the underlying issues
    resolve.


    Design idempotent retry mechanisms for duplicate-prone operations. SES may experience
    temporary failures that succeed on retry, but Odoo might interpret these as separate
    send attempts. Our implementation tracks message IDs across retry attempts, ensuring
    duplicate deliveries never occur even with multiple delivery attempts. We maintain
    retry counters with exponential backoff to prevent endless retry loops for permanently
    undeliverable messages.


    Create fallback delivery mechanisms for critical communications. When SES experiences
    prolonged outages, the system can reroute high-priority messages through alternative
    channels including Odoo''s native SMTP or third-party services. We implement priority-based
    routing that identifies must-send messages like password resets and order confirmations,
    ensuring business continuity during integration failures.


    ### Debugging and Monitoring


    Develop comprehensive logging with correlation IDs that track messages across
    Odoo and AWS systems. Each outgoing message receives a unique identifier that
    persists through Odoo processing, SES API calls, and SNS notifications. This enables
    end-to-end tracing when investigating delivery problems or performance issues.
    We structure logs for easy integration with Odoo''s native logging system and
    external monitoring tools.


    Implement real-time dashboards for delivery metrics and error rates. Create Odoo
    views that display current SES sending statistics, bounce rates, and complaint
    volumes alongside business metrics like campaign performance. This integrated
    monitoring helps administrators correlate technical issues with business impact,
    prioritizing fixes based on actual operational disruption rather than just technical
    error counts.


    Establish alert escalation procedures for different error categories. Configuration
    errors trigger immediate administrator notifications, while temporary service
    disruptions generate lower-priority alerts. We define clear response procedures
    for each error type, including automated remediation for common problems and manual
    intervention checklists for complex issues.


    ## Testing and Validation


    ### Pre-Deployment Test Scenarios


    Develop comprehensive test cases that cover all Odoo modules generating email.
    Create test scenarios for sales order confirmations, invoice notifications, CRM
    follow-ups, and marketing campaigns. Each test verifies not just successful delivery
    but also proper content rendering, attachment handling, and recipient management.
    Execute tests in a staging environment that mirrors production configuration but
    uses SES sandbox mode to prevent accidental external communication.


    Validate bounce and complaint processing with simulated SNS notifications. Use
    the SES mailbox simulator to generate controlled bounces and complaints without
    affecting your sending reputation. Verify that Odoo properly processes these notifications
    and updates recipient status accordingly. Test both hard bounces (invalid addresses)
    and soft bounces (mailbox full) to ensure different handling for each scenario.


    Perform load testing to verify integration stability under production volumes.
    Generate synthetic email traffic that matches your expected production patterns,
    including bulk marketing campaigns and transactional message spikes. Monitor system
    resources during load tests to identify potential bottlenecks in message processing,
    API rate limiting, or database performance under high email volumes.


    ### Integration Validation Checklist


    Verify domain authentication and DKIM signing for all sending domains. Use email
    header analysis tools to confirm proper alignment between your domain and SES
    infrastructure. Validate that SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records propagate correctly
    in DNS and that receiving email systems authenticate messages properly. Test delivery
    to major email providers including Gmail, Outlook, and corporate Exchange systems
    to identify any provider-specific filtering issues.


    Confirm proper tracking and analytics integration. Send test emails with open
    and click tracking enabled, then verify that these events capture in Odoo''s marketing
    statistics. Check that bounce processing updates recipient lists and that complaint
    handling creates appropriate suppression records. Validate that all tracking links
    maintain proper session context for Odoo''s website analytics.


    Audit security implementation including credential storage, API access logging,
    and webhook authentication. Verify that IAM policies enforce least privilege access
    and that sensitive credentials never log in clear text. Test webhook endpoint
    security by sending forged notifications to ensure only properly signed SNS messages
    process. Validate that all API communications use TLS encryption and certificate
    verification.


    ### Production Readiness Verification


    Execute a phased rollout that migrates specific email types incrementally. Begin
    with internal notifications and non-critical communications before progressing
    to customer-facing messages. Monitor deliverability metrics at each stage, comparing
    performance against your previous email solution. Establish clear rollback procedures
    if critical issues emerge during initial production use.


    Implement canary testing that sends duplicate messages through both SES and your
    legacy email system during transition periods. Compare delivery times, inbox placement
    rates, and engagement metrics between the two systems. Use this comparative data
    to validate SES performance and identify any configuration optimizations needed
    before full migration.


    Create ongoing monitoring checks that validate integration health. Schedule regular
    test messages that verify end-to-end delivery and bounce processing. Set up automated
    alerts for abnormal bounce rates, sending volume changes, or credential expiration.
    Establish regular review procedures for SES sending statistics and Odoo email
    analytics to identify emerging issues before they impact business operations.


    ## Security Considerations


    ### Authentication and Access Control


    Implement strict IAM role policies that follow the principle of least privilege.
    Create dedicated IAM users for Odoo integration with permissions limited to specific
    SES actions and resources. Restrict access by verified domain to prevent accidental
    or malicious sending from unauthorized domains. Use IAM conditions to constrain
    API calls to specific source IP addresses when Odoo operates from fixed infrastructure.


    Secure AWS credential storage within Odoo''s parameter system with encryption.
    Never embed credentials in code or configuration files in plaintext. Implement
    credential rotation procedures that automatically update Odoo when IAM keys approach
    expiration. For enhanced security, consider using IAM roles with instance profiles
    when Odoo runs on EC2 infrastructure, eliminating static credential management.


    Protect SNS webhook endpoints with signature verification. Amazon SNS signs all
    notifications with X.509 certificates, and your endpoint must validate these signatures
    before processing bounce or complaint notifications. Implement proper certificate
    caching and validation logic to prevent forged notifications that might corrupt
    your recipient database or tracking statistics.


    ### Data Protection and Compliance


    Encrypt all email content in transit using TLS 1.2 or higher for both API communications
    and SMTP connections. Verify certificate validity for all AWS endpoints to prevent
    man-in-the-middle attacks. For highly sensitive communications, consider implementing
    additional message-level encryption that protects content beyond transport security.


    Manage personal data in compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations.
    Implement proper data retention policies for email logs and tracking information.
    Provide mechanisms for data subject requests that export or delete personal information
    from both Odoo records and SES templates. Document data flows between systems
    for compliance auditing and privacy impact assessments.


    Secure Odoo''s email composition interfaces against injection attacks. Validate
    all user inputs that might affect email content, headers, or recipients. Implement
    strict anti-spam measures that prevent compromised user accounts from abusing
    your SES sending capability. Monitor sending patterns for anomalies that might
    indicate security breaches or credential theft.


    ### Infrastructure Security


    Harden the Odoo server environment that hosts the SES integration. Apply security
    patches regularly, configure firewalls to limit access to necessary ports, and
    implement intrusion detection monitoring. Isperate the mail processing components
    from public-facing Odoo web interfaces to reduce attack surface.


    Monitor AWS CloudTrail logs for suspicious SES API activity. Set up alerts for
    unusual sending patterns, configuration changes, or authentication failures that
    might indicate security incidents. Integrate these alerts with your existing security
    monitoring infrastructure for coordinated incident response.


    Establish security incident response procedures specific to email compromise scenarios.
    Define escalation paths, communication plans, and technical containment measures
    for situations where your SES capability becomes abused for spam or phishing.
    Practice these procedures through tabletop exercises to ensure preparedness for
    real security events.


    ## Performance Optimization


    ### SES API Efficiency


    Implement message batching for high-volume sending scenarios. Instead of individual
    API calls for each message, group multiple messages into single batch requests
    where appropriate. Balance batch size against processing overhead and error handling
    complexity. For truly massive volumes, consider using SES''s sending pipeline
    features with dedicated IP addresses for predictable performance.


    Optimize API call patterns to minimize throttling and latency. Distribute sending
    load evenly across time rather than in bursts that trigger rate limiting. Implement
    connection pooling for HTTP requests to avoid TCP handshake overhead for each
    API call. Cache frequently accessed SES resources like template definitions and
    configuration sets to reduce redundant API calls.


    Use SES''s sending statistics and CloudWatch metrics to identify performance bottlenecks.
    Monitor send rates, bounce percentages, and complaint rates for early detection
    of deliverability issues. Set up automated adjustments to sending patterns based
    on these metrics, reducing volume when engagement metrics indicate potential delivery
    problems.


    ### Odoo Processing Optimization


    Tune Odoo''s mail queue processing for efficient handling of large email volumes.
    Adjust the mail queue batch size and worker processes based on your server resources
    and typical email load. Implement priority queuing that processes transactional
    messages before bulk marketing communications to ensure time-sensitive messages
    deliver promptly.


    Optimize database performance for email-related operations. Add appropriate indexes
    to mail.message and related tables to speed up message retrieval and status updates.
    Implement periodic cleanup of old email records that no longer require immediate
    access, archiving historical data to separate storage for compliance purposes.


    Cache recipient validation results to avoid repeated address formatting and validation
    checks. For mass mailing operations, precompute recipient lists and validate addresses
    before beginning the sending process. This prevents mid-campaign failures from
    invalid addresses and improves overall sending throughput.


    ### System-Wide Tuning


    Monitor server resources during peak sending periods to identify hardware constraints.
    Scale Odoo instances horizontally for email-intensive operations, separating web
    frontends from backend mail processing. Consider dedicated queue processors for
    email operations when marketing campaigns generate temporary volume spikes.


    Implement content delivery optimization for images and tracking links in email
    campaigns. Use CDN services for hosted images to reduce load on your Odoo servers
    and improve email rendering performance. Optimize tracking link redirects to minimize
    latency in click capture and user redirection.


    Establish performance baselines and continuous monitoring to detect degradation
    over time. Track key metrics including messages per second, API latency, and end-to-end
    delivery time. Set up automated alerts when performance deviates from established
    baselines, enabling proactive optimization before users experience impact.'
