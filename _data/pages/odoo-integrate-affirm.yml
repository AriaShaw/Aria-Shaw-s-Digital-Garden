  main_content: '## Integration Architecture and Data Flow


    ### Core System Components


    The Affirm-Odoo integration relies on three primary components that handle payment
    processing. Odoo 18''s payment acquisition module manages the frontend checkout
    experience and captures payment requests. The Affirm JavaScript SDK renders the
    payment prompt on your product and cart pages. A custom integration module bridges
    both systems, handling webhook notifications and data synchronization. This architecture
    maintains separation between presentation, business logic, and external service
    layers.


    The data flow begins when customers select Affirm at checkout in your Odoo ecommerce
    store. Odoo injects the Affirm JavaScript SDK into the payment page, which displays
    Affirm''s payment options. Customers complete their Affirm application directly
    within the embedded interface. This client-side integration keeps sensitive payment
    data outside your server environment. The SDK returns a payment charge ID to Odoo
    upon successful customer approval.


    ### Server-Side Processing Sequence


    Odoo receives the charge ID and creates a pending sale order with a specific payment
    transaction. The system sends a capture request to Affirm''s API using your merchant
    credentials. Affirm processes the capture and returns a detailed payment response
    with transaction status. Odoo updates the payment transaction to confirmed status
    and prepares the order for fulfillment. This server-to-server communication ensures
    transaction integrity without exposing API keys to client-side code.


    ### Webhook Notification Handling


    Affirm sends instant payment webhooks to your Odoo endpoint for real-time status
    updates. The integration module processes these webhooks to synchronize transaction
    states between systems. Payment capture events trigger order confirmation and
    inventory reservation in Odoo. Refund notifications update accounting records
    and payment reconciliation status. This asynchronous communication prevents data
    drift between Affirm''s system and your Odoo database.


    ### Data Flow Security


    All API communications employ HTTPS with TLS 1.2 encryption for data protection.
    Affirm uses public-key authentication with separate keys for frontend and backend
    operations. Odoo stores sensitive credentials in its encrypted parameters system
    with strict access controls. The integration implements idempotency keys on all
    API requests to prevent duplicate processing. This security framework meets PCI
    DSS requirements for payment data handling.


    ## Step-by-Step Configuration


    ### Affirm Merchant Account Setup


    Begin with your Affirm merchant dashboard configuration to generate API credentials.
    Navigate to the Developer Settings section and create a new application for your
    Odoo integration. Copy the Public Key and Private Key values – you will need both
    for different integration components. Enable the production environment after
    completing successful testing with Affirm''s sandbox. Configure your webhook URL
    in the Affirm dashboard using your Odoo instance''s base URL plus ''/affirm/webhook''.


    Activate the specific payment events that trigger webhook notifications to your
    Odoo system. Enable the ''payment.captured'' event for successful transaction
    processing. Add the ''payment.voided'' event for canceled authorization requests.
    Include the ''refund.updated'' event for tracking customer refund status changes.
    These webhook configurations ensure Odoo receives real-time updates for all payment
    lifecycle events.


    ### Odoo Payment Acquirer Configuration


    Install the ''payment_affirm'' module in your Odoo 18 instance through the Apps
    menu. Navigate to Accounting → Payments → Payment Acquirers and locate the Affirm
    payment method. Switch the state from ''Disabled'' to ''Enabled'' to activate
    the payment option. Set the environment to ''Test'' for initial configuration
    and ''Production'' for go-live deployment. Input your Affirm Public Key in the
    ''Public Key'' field – this key secures frontend communication.


    Enter your Affirm Private Key in the ''Secret Key'' field for server-side API
    operations. Configure the webhook endpoint URL as ''https://your-odoo-domain.com/payment/affirm/webhook''.
    Set the payment flow to ''Direct Payment'' for immediate capture or ''Authorization''
    for delayed capture. Define the journal for Affirm transactions in the ''Journal''
    field to separate these payments. Save the configuration and test the connection
    using Affirm''s sandbox mode before production use.


    ### Custom Integration Module Development


    Create a new Odoo module named ''affirm_integration'' with the standard module
    structure. Define the model classes for storing Affirm transaction data and mapping
    to Odoo sales orders. Implement the controllers for handling webhook notifications
    and processing payment callbacks. Develop the security rules for API access and
    webhook endpoint protection. Package the module for deployment across your Odoo
    environment.


    The module requires specific dependencies on Odoo''s payment, sale, and accounting
    modules. Implement the `payment.acquirer` model extension to handle Affirm-specific
    configuration parameters. Create the `affirm.transaction` model for storing full
    payload data from Affirm API responses. Develop the `sale.order` model extension
    to add Affirm-specific fields and methods. These model extensions provide the
    data structure for seamless integration between systems.


    ### Webhook Controller Implementation


    Build a dedicated webhook controller in your integration module to process Affirm
    notifications. Implement the route ''/payment/affirm/webhook'' with CSRF protection
    disabled for external access. Create authentication middleware that validates
    webhook signatures from Affirm servers. Develop the payload processing logic that
    parses JSON data and updates corresponding Odoo records. Add comprehensive logging
    to track webhook processing for debugging and audit purposes.


    The webhook controller must handle multiple event types with appropriate business
    logic. Process ''payment.captured'' events by confirming the related Odoo payment
    transaction. Handle ''payment.voided'' events by canceling the authorization and
    related sale order. Manage ''refund.updated'' events by syncing refund status
    to Odoo accounting records. Implement idempotent processing to handle duplicate
    webhook deliveries from Affirm''s system.


    ### Frontend Payment Component Integration


    Customize your Odoo ecommerce templates to inject the Affirm JavaScript SDK at
    checkout. Add the Affirm script tag to your website layout template or specific
    checkout pages. Implement the Affirm UI configuration to match your store''s design
    and user experience. Develop the event handlers for payment success and failure
    scenarios in the checkout flow. Test the complete payment flow with Affirm''s
    test cards to validate the integration.


    The frontend code must initialize the Affirm SDK with your public key and configuration
    options. Implement the `affirm.checkout` function call when customers select Affirm
    as their payment method. Handle the `checkout-success` event by submitting the
    payment token to Odoo''s transaction processing. Manage the `checkout-cancel`
    event by redirecting customers to alternative payment options. These frontend
    components create a seamless payment experience that matches your brand identity.


    ## Data Mapping and Transformation


    ### Transaction Data Structure Mapping


    Affirm''s transaction API returns detailed payment data that must map to Odoo''s
    payment transaction model. The Affirm charge ID maps directly to Odoo''s transaction
    reference field for payment identification. The transaction amount converts from
    Affirm''s cents-based integer to Odoo''s decimal currency format. Customer information
    from Affirm''s response populates the partner data in Odoo''s sale order. This
    mapping ensures consistent payment records across both systems.


    The integration handles currency conversion when Affirm processes payments in
    different currencies than Odoo''s base currency. Exchange rate data from Odoo''s
    currency table transforms amounts during transaction recording. Affirm''s itemized
    breakdown maps to Odoo''s sale order lines for detailed accounting. Shipping addresses
    from Affirm sync with Odoo''s delivery information for fulfillment processing.
    These transformations maintain data consistency despite structural differences
    between systems.


    ### Order Status Synchronization Logic


    Affirm''s payment states determine the corresponding status updates in Odoo''s
    sale order workflow. The ''authorized'' state in Affirm creates a confirmed sale
    order with pending payment in Odoo. The ''captured'' state triggers payment confirmation
    and order readiness for fulfillment processing. The ''voided'' state cancels the
    pending payment and related sale order in Odoo. This state synchronization prevents
    order processing mismatches between systems.


    The integration implements specific business rules for handling partial captures
    and refund scenarios. Partial capture amounts update Odoo''s payment transactions
    to reflect the actual captured value. Multiple capture events against a single
    authorization create separate payment transactions in Odoo. Refund operations
    sync from Affirm to Odoo''s accounting reconciliation records. These complex scenarios
    require careful mapping to maintain financial accuracy.


    ### Customer Data Integration


    Affirm provides detailed customer information that enriches Odoo''s partner records
    during checkout. Customer email addresses from Affirm create or match existing
    partners in Odoo''s database. Phone numbers and shipping addresses update the
    partner''s contact information for future orders. Affirm''s unique customer identifier
    stores in a custom field for cross-reference purposes. This customer data integration
    improves marketing and service capabilities beyond payment processing.


    The system handles data conflicts when customer information differs between Affirm
    and existing Odoo records. The integration prioritizes the most recent data source
    based on configuration settings. Address validation rules standardize formatting
    between Affirm''s structure and Odoo''s address fields. Duplicate detection logic
    prevents partner record creation when matches exist. These data quality measures
    maintain clean customer information across both platforms.


    ### Webhook Payload Processing


    Affirm''s webhook payloads contain nested JSON structures that require flattening
    for Odoo storage. The integration extracts critical transaction identifiers from
    the nested event data structure. Payment amount and currency information maps
    to Odoo''s monetary field formats. Timestamp conversion transforms Affirm''s UTC
    timestamps to Odoo''s timezone-aware datetime fields. This payload processing
    ensures essential data persists for reporting and reconciliation.


    The system handles webhook retry scenarios and delayed processing without data
    loss. Idempotency checks prevent duplicate processing of the same webhook event
    payload. Failed webhook processing triggers alert notifications to administrative
    users for manual intervention. Payload validation rules verify data integrity
    before updating Odoo records. These reliability measures ensure webhook processing
    maintains system consistency.


    ## Error Handling and Resilience


    ### Common API Integration Errors


    The Affirm API returns specific HTTP status codes that indicate different failure
    scenarios. 401 Unauthorized errors occur with invalid private key configuration
    or expired credentials. 402 Payment Required signals declined transactions that
    require customer intervention. 422 Unprocessable Entity errors indicate invalid
    request payloads or missing required fields. 429 Too Many Requests responses trigger
    rate limiting protection in high-volume scenarios.


    The integration implements automatic retry logic for transient network failures
    and server errors. Exponential backoff algorithms handle retries for 5xx server
    errors from Affirm''s API. Circuit breaker patterns prevent cascading failures
    when Affirm experiences service degradation. Request timeouts protect against
    hung connections that could block payment processing. These resilience patterns
    maintain system availability during partial outages.


    ### Webhook Processing Failures


    Webhook delivery failures occur when your Odoo instance cannot process incoming
    notifications. Network timeouts or server overload prevent successful webhook
    payload reception. Payload validation failures reject malformed JSON or missing
    required data fields. Database constraint violations block transaction updates
    due to data integrity rules. These failures require specific handling to prevent
    data synchronization gaps.


    The integration implements dead letter queue patterns for failed webhook processing.
    Failed webhooks persist in a separate database table for manual review and reprocessing.
    Administrative alerts notify technical teams of persistent webhook processing
    failures. Manual reprocessing tools allow administrators to retry specific webhook
    events. These measures ensure temporary failures don''t create permanent data
    inconsistencies.


    ### Data Validation and Sanitization


    Input validation prevents malformed data from compromising system integrity. Amount
    validation ensures payment values fall within expected ranges for your business.
    Currency code verification matches supported currencies between Affirm and Odoo.
    Customer email validation follows standard format checks before creating partner
    records. These validation rules block invalid data before it impacts your business
    operations.


    The integration implements comprehensive sanitization for all external data inputs.
    HTML and script removal prevents injection attacks from malicious payloads. Character
    encoding normalization handles special characters in customer names and addresses.
    Size limits prevent buffer overflow attacks through excessively large payloads.
    Type conversion ensures numerical fields contain valid numeric data before processing.


    ### Recovery Procedures


    Systematic recovery procedures restore data consistency after integration failures.
    Reconciliation reports identify transactions with mismatched status between Affirm
    and Odoo. Manual synchronization tools update Odoo records based on current Affirm
    API data. Bulk processing operations handle backfilling missing transactions after
    extended outages. These recovery tools minimize manual effort when resolving data
    inconsistencies.


    The integration includes automated consistency checks that run on a scheduled
    basis. Daily validation routines compare transaction counts and amounts between
    systems. Weekly reconciliation reports highlight discrepancies for administrative
    review. Automated correction workflows fix common synchronization issues without
    manual intervention. These proactive measures prevent small errors from accumulating
    into major data problems.


    ## Testing and Validation


    ### Development Environment Testing


    Establish a complete testing environment that mirrors your production Odoo configuration.
    Create a separate Odoo database dedicated to integration testing and development.
    Configure the Affirm sandbox environment with test merchant credentials. Develop
    test cases that cover all payment scenarios and edge cases. Implement automated
    testing scripts that validate integration functionality before deployment.


    Test the complete payment flow using Affirm''s test card numbers and simulation
    tools. Use the approved test card to simulate successful payment authorization
    and capture. Test the declined card scenario to verify proper error handling and
    user messaging. Validate partial capture functionality with multiple capture operations
    against single authorizations. These tests ensure the integration handles all
    possible payment outcomes correctly.


    ### Webhook Testing Methodology


    Test webhook processing using Affirm''s webhook simulation tools in the developer
    dashboard. Simulate ''payment.captured'' events to verify order confirmation and
    inventory updates. Test ''payment.voided'' events to ensure proper order cancellation
    and payment reversal. Validate ''refund.updated'' webhooks to confirm accounting
    record synchronization. These tests guarantee real-time updates function correctly
    in both systems.


    Verify webhook security by testing signature validation with invalid and missing
    signatures. Confirm that webhooks with invalid signatures receive proper rejection
    responses. Test webhook idempotency by sending duplicate events to prevent double-processing.
    Validate error handling by sending malformed payloads to your webhook endpoint.
    These security tests protect your integration from malicious or erroneous webhook
    traffic.


    ### Integration Validation Checklist


    Execute a comprehensive validation checklist before moving the integration to
    production. Verify that all Affirm API credentials configure correctly in the
    Odoo payment acquirer. Confirm that the webhook endpoint registers properly in
    the Affirm merchant dashboard. Test the complete customer checkout flow from product
    selection to order confirmation. Validate that payment transactions appear correctly
    in both Affirm and Odoo reporting.


    Perform load testing to ensure the integration handles your expected transaction
    volumes. Simulate peak traffic patterns to identify performance bottlenecks and
    resource constraints. Test concurrent payment processing to verify database locking
    and race condition handling. Validate system behavior under network latency and
    partial outage scenarios. These performance tests guarantee reliable operation
    during business-critical periods.


    ### User Acceptance Testing


    Involve business stakeholders in user acceptance testing to validate operational
    readiness. Train customer service teams on the new payment flow and common customer
    scenarios. Educate accounting staff on reconciliation procedures and reporting
    capabilities. Prepare operations teams for order fulfillment processes with Affirm
    payments. Document support procedures for handling payment disputes and customer
    inquiries.


    Create test scenarios that reflect real-world business operations and edge cases.
    Test guest checkout flows to ensure customer data captures correctly without existing
    accounts. Validate coupon and discount applications with Affirm payment processing.
    Test inventory reservation and release for both successful and failed payments.
    These business process tests ensure the integration supports your complete operational
    workflow.


    ## Security Considerations


    ### Authentication and Access Control


    The integration implements multiple authentication layers to protect payment data.
    Affirm uses public-key cryptography with separate keys for frontend and backend
    operations. Odoo stores these credentials in its encrypted parameters system with
    strict access controls. API requests include timestamp-based signatures that prevent
    replay attacks. These authentication measures ensure only authorized systems can
    process payments.


    Webhook endpoints implement signature verification to confirm Affirm as the request
    source. The system validates HMAC signatures using your webhook secret key before
    processing notifications. Invalid signature requests receive immediate rejection
    without further processing. This verification prevents malicious actors from injecting
    false payment notifications. The security model maintains integrity throughout
    the payment lifecycle.


    ### Data Protection Measures


    All API communications employ TLS 1.2 encryption for data in transit between systems.
    Odoo database encryption protects sensitive customer and payment data at rest.
    The integration follows principle of least access for database queries and API
    operations. Payment card data never touches your servers, remaining within Affirm''s
    PCI-compliant environment. These protections meet industry standards for financial
    data security.


    The integration implements comprehensive logging for security monitoring and audit
    purposes. Access logs track all API interactions between Odoo and Affirm''s payment
    systems. Audit trails record payment state changes and administrative actions
    within Odoo. Security alerts trigger on suspicious patterns like multiple failed
    authentication attempts. These monitoring capabilities support security incident
    investigation and compliance reporting.


    ### Compliance Requirements


    The integration helps maintain PCI DSS compliance by keeping sensitive data outside
    your environment. Affirm handles all PCI-sensitive data elements through their
    certified payment platform. Odoo stores only transaction identifiers and metadata
    for order processing. This architecture reduces your PCI compliance scope and
    associated validation requirements. Regular security assessments verify continued
    compliance with evolving standards.


    Data privacy measures address GDPR, CCPA, and other regulatory requirements. Customer
    data processing follows privacy-by-design principles throughout the integration.
    Data retention policies automatically purge unnecessary personal information after
    business needs expire. Data subject access rights extend to information stored
    in both Odoo and through Affirm''s privacy tools. These protections demonstrate
    commitment to customer privacy and regulatory compliance.


    ## Performance Optimization


    ### API Call Optimization


    The integration implements strategic API call patterns to minimize latency and
    resource consumption. Batch processing combines multiple operations into single
    API calls where Affirm supports this functionality. Request caching stores frequently
    accessed data like product information to reduce redundant API calls. Connection
    pooling maintains persistent HTTP connections to Affirm''s API endpoints. These
    optimizations reduce network overhead and improve response times.


    The system employs intelligent polling strategies for status checks instead of
    constant API queries. Webhook-driven updates eliminate the need for most polling
    operations entirely. For scenarios requiring polling, exponential backoff algorithms
    prevent unnecessary API load. Priority queues ensure time-sensitive operations
    like capture requests process before background tasks. These patterns balance
    responsiveness with API efficiency.


    ### Database Performance Tuning


    Odoo database optimization ensures efficient payment transaction processing during
    peak loads. Indexed fields on transaction tables accelerate webhook processing
    and order lookups. Query optimization reduces database load during payment synchronization
    and reporting operations. Connection pooling manages database resources across
    concurrent payment processing requests. These database improvements maintain performance
    under high transaction volumes.


    The integration implements efficient locking strategies to prevent race conditions
    without blocking performance. Optimistic concurrency control handles most payment
    status updates without row-level locking. Pessimistic locking reserves critical
    operations like inventory allocation during order confirmation. These locking
    strategies balance data integrity with system throughput for optimal performance.


    ### Caching Strategies


    Multi-level caching reduces latency for frequently accessed data and configuration
    settings. Redis caching stores Affirm API responses for product eligibility checks
    and pricing information. Database query caching accelerates transaction lookups
    during webhook processing. CDN caching improves frontend performance for Affirm''s
    JavaScript SDK and UI assets. These caching layers deliver responsive performance
    despite complex integration logic.


    The cache invalidation strategy ensures data consistency while maximizing cache
    effectiveness. Webhook events trigger cache invalidation for related transaction
    and order data. Time-based expiration removes stale data that could cause display
    inconsistencies. Manual cache clearance tools allow administrators to force refresh
    during business operations. These invalidation rules maintain accuracy while benefiting
    from performance improvements.


    ### Monitoring and Metrics


    Comprehensive monitoring provides visibility into integration performance and
    health status. Performance metrics track API response times, error rates, and
    transaction processing latency. Business metrics monitor conversion rates, payment
    method adoption, and revenue impact. System metrics watch resource utilization,
    database performance, and queue depths. These metrics identify optimization opportunities
    and prevent performance degradation.


    Alerting rules notify technical teams of performance issues before they impact
    customers. Response time thresholds trigger alerts when API latency exceeds service
    level objectives. Error rate monitors detect integration problems that require
    immediate investigation. Resource utilization alerts prevent system overload during
    traffic spikes. These proactive measures maintain consistent performance through
    changing business conditions.'
