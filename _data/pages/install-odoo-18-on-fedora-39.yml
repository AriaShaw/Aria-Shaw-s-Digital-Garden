  main_content: "## System Architecture and Component Integration\n\nOdoo 18 operates\
    \ on a multi-tier architecture that separates presentation, application, and data\
    \ layers. The core framework uses Python 3.11 with specific library dependencies\
    \ that Fedora 39 provides through its native package manager. PostgreSQL serves\
    \ as the primary database engine, storing all business data, user configurations,\
    \ and application states. This separation ensures transactional integrity while\
    \ supporting horizontal scaling strategies.\n\nThe web interface leverages QWeb\
    \ templating engine combined with JavaScript frameworks for dynamic content rendering.\
    \ Nginx functions as a reverse proxy, handling client requests and serving static\
    \ assets without engaging the Python application server. This architecture optimizes\
    \ resource utilization by separating static and dynamic content delivery. The\
    \ system employs worker processes that handle concurrent user requests through\
    \ multiprocessing.\n\nComponent communication follows strict protocol patterns.\
    \ Python modules interact with PostgreSQL via psycopg2 adapter, implementing connection\
    \ pooling for database operations. The framework uses ORM methods that translate\
    \ Python objects into SQL queries, maintaining data consistency across transactions.\
    \ All external requests pass through Nginx, which applies SSL termination and\
    \ rate limiting before forwarding to Odoo workers.\n\nData flows through defined\
    \ pipelines that transform user inputs into persistent records. Browser requests\
    \ reach Nginx on port 80 or 443, then route to Odoo's XML-RPC or JSON-RPC endpoints.\
    \ The application server processes requests through controller methods that validate\
    \ parameters and execute business logic. Successful operations commit changes\
    \ to PostgreSQL, while failures trigger rollback procedures that maintain database\
    \ consistency.\n\n## Prerequisites and System Preparation\n\nFedora 39 requires\
    \ specific preparation before Odoo installation. Begin with a comprehensive system\
    \ update to ensure all security patches and performance improvements apply. The\
    \ process demands administrative privileges, so verify your sudo access before\
    \ proceeding. System preparation establishes the foundation for all subsequent\
    \ installation steps and prevents dependency conflicts.\n\nExecute these commands\
    \ to update your system and install essential packages:\n```\nsudo dnf update\
    \ -y\nsudo dnf install -y python3 python3-devel git gcc redhat-rpm-config openssl-devel\
    \ libxml2-devel libxslt-devel\n```\nThese packages provide the development tools\
    \ necessary for compiling Python extensions and managing Odoo dependencies. The\
    \ python3-devel package contains header files required for building Python modules\
    \ with C extensions. Development tools ensure the system can compile various Python\
    \ packages from source code.\n\nCreate a dedicated system user account for Odoo\
    \ operations. This security measure confines the application to a restricted environment,\
    \ limiting potential damage from security breaches. Isolated user accounts represent\
    \ standard security practice for production deployments. Implement the user creation\
    \ with these commands:\n\n```\nsudo useradd -m -d /opt/odoo -U -r -s /bin/bash\
    \ odoo\n```\nThe command creates a user named 'odoo' with a home directory at\
    \ /opt/odoo. The '-r' flag designates this as a system account, while '-U' simultaneously\
    \ creates a matching group. This user will own all Odoo processes and files, maintaining\
    \ proper permission structures.\n\nVerify the Python 3 version matches Fedora\
    \ 39's expected release. The system should report Python 3.11 or newer, which\
    \ provides the necessary features for Odoo 18. Check the version with `python3\
    \ --version` and confirm the output. This validation prevents runtime errors caused\
    \ by version incompatibilities that could disrupt business operations.\n\n## PostgreSQL\
    \ Database Configuration\n\nOdoo requires a robust database backend, and PostgreSQL\
    \ delivers enterprise-grade reliability. Install PostgreSQL and its development\
    \ libraries using Fedora's package manager. The development libraries enable Python\
    \ database connectors to compile and function correctly. Database configuration\
    \ occurs before Odoo installation to ensure immediate availability.\n\nExecute\
    \ the installation command:\n```\nsudo dnf install -y postgresql postgresql-server\
    \ postgresql-devel postgresql-contrib\n```\nInitialize the database cluster with\
    \ `sudo postgresql-setup --initdb --unit postgresql`. This command creates the\
    \ necessary data structures and configuration files in /var/lib/pgsql/data. Start\
    \ the database service with `sudo systemctl enable --now postgresql`. The service\
    \ must remain active throughout the Odoo installation and operation.\n\nCreate\
    \ a dedicated database user for Odoo operations. This practice separates application\
    \ data from administrative accounts, enhancing security. Access the PostgreSQL\
    \ prompt with `sudo -u postgres psql` and execute these commands:\n\n```\nCREATE\
    \ USER odoo WITH CREATEDB PASSWORD 'secure_password';\nALTER USER odoo CREATEDB;\n\
    ```\nReplace 'secure_password' with a strong, unique passphrase that meets security\
    \ standards. The CREATEDB privilege permits Odoo to generate new databases for\
    \ multi-tenant deployments or testing environments. This capability supports operational\
    \ flexibility while maintaining security boundaries.\n\nConfigure PostgreSQL connection\
    \ settings for enhanced performance and security. Edit /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf\
    \ to modify key parameters. Set `max_connections = 80` to accommodate Odoo worker\
    \ processes and database operations. Adjust `shared_buffers` to 25% of available\
    \ system memory for optimal caching performance. These adjustments ensure the\
    \ database handles Odoo's workload efficiently.\n\n## Python Environment and Dependencies\\\
    n\nOdoo 18 operates within a controlled Python environment that manages dependency\
    \ versions. Python virtual environments prevent conflicts between system packages\
    \ and application requirements. This isolation ensures Odoo's specific library\
    \ versions don't interfere with system utilities or other applications. The approach\
    \ maintains system stability while accommodating Odoo's precise dependencies.\n\
    \nCreate a virtual environment in the Odoo user's home directory. Switch to the\
    \ odoo user account with `sudo su - odoo` and execute these commands:\n\n```\n\
    python3 -m venv odoo-venv\nsource odoo-venv/bin/activate\n```\nThe virtual environment\
    \ activates, modifying your shell prompt to indicate the active context. All subsequent\
    \ Python package installations will occur within this isolated space, separate\
    \ from the system's Python distribution. This containment strategy simplifies\
    \ dependency management and future upgrades.\n\nInstall Wheel package before other\
    \ dependencies to ensure proper binary package handling. The command `pip install\
    \ wheel` optimizes installation of Python packages with compiled components. This\
    \ step accelerates subsequent package installations and prevents common build\
    \ errors. Wheel support is particularly important for numerical computing libraries\
    \ Odoo utilizes.\n\nInstall Odoo's core dependencies using pip within the activated\
    \ virtual environment:\n```\npip install psycopg2-binary lxml libsass python-dateutil\
    \ polib passlib werkzeug psutil html2text docutils pillow mock jinja2 pyyaml\n\
    ```\nThese packages provide database connectivity, XML processing, Sass compilation,\
    \ and various utility functions Odoo requires. The psycopg2-binary package offers\
    \ a precompiled PostgreSQL adapter, eliminating compilation requirements during\
    \ installation. Each dependency addresses specific functional areas within the\
    \ Odoo framework.\n\nAdditional packages require installation for specialized\
    \ Odoo features. Reporting capabilities need `pip install pyldap vobject pyopenssl`\
    \ for advanced authentication and data exchange formats. Electronic payment processing\
    \ requires `pip install num2words ofxparse` for currency handling and financial\
    \ data interpretation. These specialized packages extend Odoo's core functionality\
    \ for enterprise use cases.\n\nVerify the installation completeness with `pip\
    \ list | grep odoo`. Although Odoo itself isn't installed via pip yet, this command\
    \ confirms all prerequisite packages installed correctly. A successful dependency\
    \ installation shows no error messages and prepares the environment for Odoo framework\
    \ deployment.\n\n## Odoo 18 Source Code Installation\n\nObtain the Odoo 18 source\
    \ code from the official repository. The Git version control system manages code\
    \ retrieval and future updates. Source code installation provides full control\
    \ over the deployment and enables customization opportunities. This method supports\
    \ production environments that require specific modifications or extensions.\n\
    \nAs the odoo user, clone the repository into the home directory:\n```\ngit clone\
    \ https://github.com/odoo/odoo.git --branch 18.0 --depth 1 /opt/odoo/odoo-18\n\
    ```\nThe `--branch 18.0` parameter ensures you retrieve the stable version branch\
    \ for Odoo 18. The `--depth 1` option creates a shallow clone with only the latest\
    \ revision, conserving disk space and download time. The target directory organizes\
    \ the code for clear version management.\n\nInstall Odoo's Python requirements\
    \ using the project's specification file. Navigate to the source directory with\
    \ `cd /opt/odoo/odoo-18` and execute:\n```\npip install -r requirements.txt\n\
    ```\nThis command processes the requirements.txt file included in the Odoo source,\
    \ installing all framework dependencies with compatible versions. The file contains\
    \ precise version specifications that prevent conflicts between packages. This\
    \ automated approach ensures dependency consistency across deployments.\n\nCreate\
    \ the Odoo configuration file that controls application behavior. The configuration\
    \ file dictates database connections, server ports, file paths, and security settings.\
    \ Create /opt/odoo/odoo-18.conf with these essential parameters:\n\n```\n[options]\n\
    admin_passwd = super_admin_password\ndb_host = localhost\ndb_port = 5432\ndb_user\
    \ = odoo\ndb_password = secure_password\naddons_path = /opt/odoo/odoo-18/addons\n\
    data_dir = /var/lib/odoo\nxmlrpc_port = 8069\n```\nThe admin_passwd secures the\
    \ database management interface with a master password. The addons_path directs\
    \ Odoo to core modules, while data_dir specifies storage for attachments and session\
    \ data. These parameters establish the basic operational framework.\n\nVerify\
    \ the installation by testing Odoo's ability to start. Execute `python3 /opt/odoo/odoo-18/odoo-bin\
    \ --config /opt/odoo/odoo-18.conf --save --stop-after-init`. This command initializes\
    \ the Odoo system without starting the server, validating all configurations and\
    \ dependencies. Successful execution produces no error messages and creates the\
    \ session data directory.\n\n## Systemd Service Configuration\n\nProduction deployments\
    \ require reliable service management that systemd provides. The systemd service\
    \ manager ensures Odoo starts automatically upon system boot and restarts after\
    \ failures. This approach maintains application availability without manual intervention.\
    \ Service configuration standardizes the operational environment across deployments.\n\
    \nCreate the service configuration file at /etc/systemd/system/odoo.service with\
    \ root privileges. The file contains service definitions that control process\
    \ execution, user context, and resource management. Use this template for optimal\
    \ operation:\n\n```\n[Unit]\nDescription=Odoo 18 ERP System\nDocumentation=https://www.odoo.com/documentation/18.0/\n\
    After=postgresql.target\n\n[Service]\nType=simple\nUser=odoo\nGroup=odoo\nExecStart=/opt/odoo/odoo-venv/bin/python3\
    \ /opt/odoo/odoo-18/odoo-bin --config /opt/odoo/odoo-18.conf\nKillMode=mixed\n\
    Restart=on-failure\nRestartSec=5\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n```\n\
    The service definition specifies the odoo user context for security containment.\
    \ The Restart parameters ensure automatic recovery from process failures, while\
    \ the After directive maintains proper startup sequencing after PostgreSQL availability.\n\
    \nReload systemd to recognize the new service configuration. Execute `sudo systemctl\
    \ daemon-reload` to refresh the systemd manager configuration. This command makes\
    \ the new service definition available for management without restarting the system.\
    \ Service reloading is essential after any configuration changes.\n\nEnable the\
    \ Odoo service to start automatically at system boot with `sudo systemctl enable\
    \ odoo`. This command creates the necessary symbolic links in systemd's target\
    \ directories. Automatic startup ensures business continuity following system\
    \ maintenance or unexpected reboots. The enable operation doesn't immediately\
    \ start the service.\n\nStart the Odoo service with `sudo systemctl start odoo`\
    \ and verify its status using `sudo systemctl status odoo`. The status command\
    \ displays active process information, recent log entries, and service health.\
    \ Successful service activation shows 'active (running)' status and confirms proper\
    \ integration with systemd's process management.\n\n## Nginx Reverse Proxy Configuration\\\
    n\nNginx functions as a reverse proxy that handles client connections and serves\
    \ static content. This architecture improves performance by offloading static\
    \ resource delivery from the Python application server. Reverse proxy configuration\
    \ also enables SSL termination and security header implementation. The setup enhances\
    \ both security and performance characteristics.\n\nInstall Nginx using Fedora's\
    \ package manager with `sudo dnf install -y nginx`. The installation includes\
    \ the web server binary, default configuration structures, and systemd integration.\
    \ Nginx operates on port 80 by default, but will configure for SSL termination\
    \ in subsequent steps. The web server handles external requests before they reach\
    \ Odoo.\n\nCreate a dedicated Nginx configuration file for Odoo at /etc/nginx/conf.d/odoo.conf.\
    \ The file contains server blocks that define request handling rules and upstream\
    \ connections. Use this configuration template:\n\n```\nupstream odoo {\n    server\
    \ 127.0.0.1:8069;\n}\n\nserver {\n    listen 80;\n    server_name your_domain.com;\n\
    \    \n    location / {\n        proxy_pass http://odoo;\n        proxy_set_header\
    \ X-Forwarded-Host $host;\n        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;\n\
    \        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;\n    }\n    \n    location\
    \ /web/static/ {\n        alias /opt/odoo/odoo-18/odoo/addons/web/static/;\n \
    \       expires 1y;\n        add_header Cache-Control public;\n    }\n}\n```\n\
    The upstream block defines the connection to Odoo's application server, while\
    \ the server block configures virtual host settings. The static file location\
    \ directive improves performance by serving CSS, JavaScript, and images directly\
    \ from disk with long cache expiration.\n\nTest the Nginx configuration syntax\
    \ with `sudo nginx -t`. This validation check identifies syntax errors or misconfigured\
    \ directives before applying changes. Successful testing displays a message confirming\
    \ the configuration file syntax is correct. This preventive measure avoids service\
    \ interruptions from configuration errors.\n\nRestart Nginx to apply the new configuration\
    \ with `sudo systemctl restart nginx`. Verify the service status with `sudo systemctl\
    \ status nginx` to confirm proper operation. The restart operation loads the new\
    \ Odoo configuration while maintaining existing connections through graceful process\
    \ management. Nginx now proxies requests to Odoo while serving static content\
    \ directly.\n\n## SSL Certificate Implementation with Let's Encrypt\n\nProduction\
    \ environments require encrypted connections to protect sensitive business data.\
    \ Let's Encrypt provides free SSL certificates through an automated validation\
    \ process. Certificate installation enables HTTPS connections that encrypt data\
    \ between clients and your Odoo instance. This security measure is essential for\
    \ any internet-facing deployment.\n\nInstall Certbot, the Let's Encrypt client,\
    \ and the Nginx plugin using Fedora's package manager. The command `sudo dnf install\
    \ -y certbot python3-certbot-nginx` installs both the core certificate management\
    \ tool and Nginx integration components. The Nginx plugin automates certificate\
    \ installation and configuration updates, simplifying the process.\n\nObtain and\
    \ install the SSL certificate with a single command:\n```\nsudo certbot --nginx\
    \ -d your_domain.com\n```\nReplace 'your_domain.com' with your actual domain name\
    \ that points to the server's IP address. Certbot performs domain validation by\
    \ creating temporary files that the Let's Encrypt authority verifies. Successful\
    \ validation results in certificate issuance and automatic Nginx configuration\
    \ updates.\n\nCertbot modifies the Nginx configuration to include SSL settings\
    \ and redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS. The updated configuration includes modern\
    \ security practices like strong cipher suites and HTTP/2 support. Verify the\
    \ changes by examining /etc/nginx/conf.d/odoo.conf, which now contains additional\
    \ SSL-related directives.\n\nConfigure automatic certificate renewal to maintain\
    \ continuous SSL protection. Let's Encrypt certificates expire after 90 days,\
    \ requiring regular renewal. Test the renewal process with `sudo certbot renew\
    \ --dry-run`. This command verifies the renewal mechanism works without actually\
    \ obtaining new certificates.\n\nSet up a cron job for automated renewal by adding\
    \ this line to the root user's crontab:\n```\n0 12 * * * /usr/bin/certbot renew\
    \ --quiet\n```\nThe cron job executes daily at noon, attempting renewal for certificates\
    \ approaching expiration. The `--quiet` flag suppresses output unless action is\
    \ required. Automated renewal ensures uninterrupted SSL protection without manual\
    \ intervention.\n\nUpdate Odoo's configuration to recognize the reverse proxy\
    \ setup. Modify /opt/odoo/odoo-18.conf to include these parameters:\n```\nproxy_mode\
    \ = True\nx_forwarded_for = True\n```\nThese directives ensure Odoo generates\
    \ correct URLs using the HTTPS protocol and client IP addresses from the X-Forwarded-For\
    \ header. Without these settings, Odoo might redirect to HTTP or log incorrect\
    \ client addresses, disrupting functionality.\n\n## Security Hardening and Access\
    \ Controls\n\nOdoo deployments require rigorous security measures to protect business\
    \ data. Security hardening begins with file permission management that restricts\
    \ access to configuration and data files. Proper permission structures prevent\
    \ unauthorized users from reading sensitive information or modifying application\
    \ behavior. These controls form the foundation of deployment security.\n\nSet\
    \ strict ownership and permissions on Odoo directories with these commands:\n\
    ```\nsudo chown -R odoo:odoo /opt/odoo/\nsudo chmod 755 /opt/odoo/\nsudo chmod\
    \ 640 /opt/odoo/odoo-18.conf\n```\nThe configuration file receives restricted\
    \ permissions that prevent world read access, protecting database credentials\
    \ and security settings. The odoo user maintains exclusive write access to application\
    \ code and data directories, limiting potential attack surfaces.\n\nConfigure\
    \ PostgreSQL to accept only local connections by modifying /var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf.\
    \ Ensure the authentication methods for local connections use md5 or peer authentication:\n\
    \n```\nhost    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            md5\nhost\
    \    all             all             ::1/128                 md5\n```\nThese settings\
    \ restrict database access to local processes while requiring password authentication.\
    \ Network exposure elimination prevents external attacks targeting the database\
    \ service directly. This layer of security complements the application-level protections.\n\
    \nImplement fail2ban to protect against brute force attacks on the authentication\
    \ system. Install with `sudo dnf install -y fail2ban` and create /etc/fail2ban/jail.d/odoo.conf:\n\
    \n```\n[odoo]\nenabled = true\nport = 8069,443\nprotocol = tcp\nfilter = odoo\n\
    logpath = /var/log/odoo/odoo-server.log\nmaxretry = 5\nbantime = 3600\n```\nFail2ban\
    \ monitors authentication logs and automatically blocks IP addresses that exhibit\
    \ malicious behavior. The service reduces the risk of credential stuffing attacks\
    \ that target weak user passwords.\n\nRegular security updates maintain protection\
    \ against newly discovered vulnerabilities. Configure automatic security updates\
    \ with `sudo dnf install -y dnf-automatic` and enable the timer with `sudo systemctl\
    \ enable --now dnf-automatic.timer`. Automated updates ensure timely patching\
    \ without constant manual intervention, closing security gaps rapidly.\n\n## Performance\
    \ Optimization and Monitoring\n\nOdoo performance depends on proper resource allocation\
    \ and configuration tuning. The multi-process architecture utilizes multiple CPU\
    \ cores through worker processes that handle concurrent requests. Worker configuration\
    \ balances resource usage against response time requirements. Optimal settings\
    \ maximize throughput without exhausting system resources.\n\nAdjust Odoo's worker\
    \ configuration in /opt/odoo/odoo-18.conf based on available system resources:\n\
    ```\nworkers = 4\nlimit_memory_soft = 1073741824\nlimit_memory_hard = 2147483648\n\
    limit_request = 8192\nlimit_time_cpu = 60\nlimit_time_real = 120\n```\nThe workers\
    \ parameter should equal (CPU cores * 2) + 1, with 4 workers suitable for dual-core\
    \ systems. Memory limits prevent worker processes from consuming excessive RAM,\
    \ while time limits abort requests that exceed reasonable execution durations.\
    \ These settings prevent resource exhaustion under heavy loads.\n\nPostgreSQL\
    \ performance tuning significantly impacts overall system responsiveness. Modify\
    \ /var/lib/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf to include these optimizations:\n```\nshared_buffers\
    \ = 1GB\neffective_cache_size = 3GB\nwork_mem = 16MB\nmaintenance_work_mem = 256MB\n\
    ```\nThese values assume a system with 4GB of available RAM. shared_buffers controls\
    \ how much memory PostgreSQL allocates for caching, while effective_cache_size\
    \ helps the query planner make better decisions. Adjust these values proportionally\
    \ for systems with different memory capacities.\n\nImplement caching for static\
    \ assets through Nginx configuration to reduce application server load. Extend\
    \ the /etc/nginx/conf.d/odoo.conf static files location with additional directives:\n\
    \n```\nlocation /web/static/ {\n    alias /opt/odoo/odoo-18/odoo/addons/web/static/;\n\
    \    expires 1y;\n    add_header Cache-Control public;\n    add_header ETag \"\
    \";\n    break;\n}\n```\nThe configuration instructs browsers to cache static\
    \ resources for one year, significantly reducing repeat requests for CSS, JavaScript,\
    \ and image files. The ETag header removal prevents conditional requests that\
    \ still require server processing.\n\nSet up comprehensive monitoring to track\
    \ system health and performance metrics. Install and configure Prometheus node\
    \ exporter with `sudo dnf install -y prometheus-node_exporter`. The exporter provides\
    \ system-level metrics including CPU utilization, memory consumption, and disk\
    \ I/O. Regular monitoring identifies performance degradation before it impacts\
    \ users."
