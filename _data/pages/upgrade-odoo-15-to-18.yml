  main_content: '## Pre-Migration Assessment and Planning


    ### Conducting Comprehensive System Inventory


    Begin with a complete technical audit of your Odoo 15 installation covering modules,
    data, and integrations. Document all custom modules with their exact version numbers,
    installation sources, and interdependencies. Create a detailed inventory of standard
    Odoo modules, community apps from OCA repositories, and proprietary third-party
    applications with their compatibility status. Map database relationships between
    models, especially custom many2one and many2many fields that could break during
    version migration. Record all external system connections including payment gateways,
    shipping carriers, CRM platforms, reporting tools, and B2B integration partners.


    Run `pip freeze > odoo15_requirements.txt` to capture all Python dependencies
    with exact versions for comparison with Odoo 18 requirements. Execute PostgreSQL
    queries to measure table sizes, record counts, and identify data quality issues
    like duplicate records or orphaned data. Query your database to analyze attachment
    storage consumption with `SELECT SUM(file_size) FROM ir_attachment`. Document
    current server infrastructure specifications including CPU cores, RAM allocation,
    disk I/O performance metrics, and network bandwidth capacity. This comprehensive
    assessment forms your migration blueprint and reveals potential conflict areas
    requiring attention.


    ### Analyzing Custom Module Compatibility


    Review each custom module for Odoo 18 compatibility by examining code dependencies
    and API usage. Search for deprecated API decorators like `@api.one` and `@api.multi`
    that need conversion to modern patterns. Identify JavaScript code using the old
    web client framework that requires migration to the Owl component system. Check
    XML views for deprecated attributes and widget types no longer supported in Odoo
    18.


    Create a module complexity assessment categorizing each custom module as low,
    medium, or high migration effort. Low complexity modules need only manifest updates
    and minor syntax adjustments. Medium complexity modules require view restructuring
    and moderate refactoring. High complexity modules demand significant rewrites
    due to framework changes in the ORM, web client, or reporting system. This analysis
    determines your development workload and project timeline.


    ### Planning Target Architecture


    Design your Odoo 18 architecture to leverage performance improvements while maintaining
    business continuity. Odoo 18 introduces a redesigned ORM with improved query optimization
    through better SQL generation and caching. Plan for the new Owl-based web client
    architecture that replaces the legacy Backbone.js framework. Select PostgreSQL
    14 or 15 for optimal performance—Odoo 18 performs best on these versions with
    enhanced indexing and query planner improvements.


    Decide on your deployment topology based on user count and data volume. Single-server
    setups work well for under 50 concurrent users with moderate data. Multi-server
    architectures with separate application and database tiers support larger deployments.
    Consider implementing Nginx as a reverse proxy for SSL termination, caching, and
    load balancing across multiple Odoo workers. Design backup strategies with defined
    retention policies, recovery time objectives, and tested restoration procedures.


    ### Establishing Migration Timelines


    Build a realistic project timeline based on your assessment findings, allocating
    4-8 weeks for the complete migration. Reserve 1-2 weeks for environment setup
    and custom module adaptation. Allocate 1 week for data migration testing with
    sample datasets. Plan 1-2 weeks for user acceptance testing with key stakeholders.
    Include 1 week buffer for unexpected issues and performance tuning. Schedule your
    production cutover during low-activity periods like weekends or month-end after
    financial close. This structured timeline ensures thorough testing while managing
    stakeholder expectations.


    ## Environment Preparation and Module Migration


    ### Setting Up Odoo 18 Environments


    Build multiple Odoo 18 environments for controlled testing and deployment. Install
    Odoo 18 on fresh Ubuntu 22.04 LTS servers with Python 3.10 and PostgreSQL 14.
    Configure development environments for module adaptation work with full debugging
    enabled. Create staging environments that mirror production specifications exactly—identical
    CPU, RAM, disk, and module configuration. Establish production environment with
    capacity for growth, provisioning 20-30% extra resources beyond current usage.


    Install Odoo 18 using official packages for stable deployments or from source
    for maximum control over customizations. Configure proper file permissions with
    dedicated odoo user accounts running services. Set up systemd service files for
    automatic startup and process management. Install required system dependencies
    including wkhtmltopdf for PDF reports, Node.js for asset compilation, and development
    libraries for Python packages.


    ### Adapting Custom Modules for Odoo 18


    Systematically update each custom module for Odoo 18 compatibility starting with
    manifest files. Update manifest version to `18.0.1.0.0` and verify all dependencies
    exist in Odoo 18. Replace deprecated manifest keys with current equivalents. Update
    Python imports to use current module paths and class names.


    Refactor Python code to use modern API patterns. Replace `@api.one` decorators
    with proper recordset iteration or `@api.model` for class methods. Convert `@api.multi`
    to standard methods that natively handle recordsets. Update `@api.depends` decorators
    with correct field paths for computed fields. Modernize field definitions using
    new-style declarations with proper attributes. Replace deprecated `self.pool`
    references with `self.env` for all model access.


    Update XML views for the new web client structure. Convert form views to use modern
    field widgets and responsive layout components. Update tree views with current
    decoration attributes and optional features. Adapt kanban views to leverage Odoo
    18''s improved card layouts. Modify QWeb templates to use current `t-` directive
    syntax. Remove dependencies on deprecated jQuery plugins and replace with approved
    alternatives or native JavaScript.


    Test each custom module individually in isolated Odoo 18 instances before integration.
    Create unit tests for business logic, computed fields, and constraint enforcement.
    Build integration tests verifying module interactions with standard Odoo features.
    Run performance tests identifying slow queries or memory leaks. Document all changes
    made to each module for future reference and maintenance.


    ### Migrating Third-Party Applications


    Identify all third-party applications and verify Odoo 18 compatibility with vendors.
    Check the Odoo App Store for updated versions compatible with version 18. Contact
    vendors directly for enterprise applications requiring upgrade quotes. Evaluate
    alternatives if current vendors no longer support their applications.


    Test payment gateway integrations in sandbox environments before production deployment.
    Validate Stripe, PayPal, Authorize.net, and other processor connections handle
    transactions correctly. Update API credentials and webhook endpoints for the new
    installation. Test refund processing, subscription management, and payment method
    tokenization.


    Validate e-commerce platform integrations including Shopify, WooCommerce, and
    Magento connectors. Test product synchronization, inventory updates, and order
    import workflows. Verify customer data mapping and order status updates function
    correctly. Confirm shipping carrier API integrations with FedEx, UPS, DHL calculate
    accurate rates and generate proper labels.


    ## Data Migration Architecture


    ### Designing Migration Data Pipelines


    Architect a robust three-stage data migration pipeline handling extraction, transformation,
    and loading with proper dependency management. Stage one extracts data from Odoo
    15 using XML-RPC API calls or direct PostgreSQL access for large datasets. Stage
    two transforms data to match Odoo 18 schema requirements, handling field renames,
    type changes, and selection value updates. Stage three loads data into Odoo 18
    using ORM methods that enforce business logic and constraints.


    Plan sequential migration waves based on data dependencies. Wave one handles base
    data including res.country, res.currency, product.category, and account.account
    that other records reference. Wave two processes master data like res.partner,
    product.product, and res.users that transactional data depends on. Wave three
    migrates transactional data including sale.order, account.move, and stock.picking
    with proper parent record references. Wave four addresses configuration data like
    ir.cron schedules, ir.actions automation, and ir.rule security rules.


    Implement batching strategies for datasets exceeding 100,000 records. Process
    records in chunks of 1,000-5,000 to manage memory consumption and prevent database
    connection timeouts. Create checkpoint mechanisms tracking processed record IDs
    enabling migration resume after failures. Design your pipeline to run idempotently—rerunning
    the same migration produces identical results without duplication.


    ### Building Extraction Scripts


    Develop Python extraction scripts connecting to Odoo 15 via XML-RPC for API-based
    access or psycopg2 for direct database queries. Use XML-RPC for standard data
    with proper business logic enforcement. Use direct SQL for performance-critical
    extractions of large tables or when bypassing Odoo''s access rules.


    Extract data with proper relationship preservation. Export many2one field IDs
    alongside human-readable display names for validation. Handle many2many relationships
    by capturing all linked record IDs. Store data in JSON format preserving complex
    data structures or CSV for simple tabular data. Include metadata like creation
    dates, last modification times, and record active status.


    Implement progress tracking logging extraction speed and record counts. Monitor
    for errors during extraction and implement retry logic for transient failures.
    Validate extracted data completeness by comparing record counts between source
    and export files. Create data quality reports identifying duplicate records, missing
    required fields, or invalid foreign key references.


    ### Implementing Transformation Logic


    Map Odoo 15 data structures to Odoo 18 schema with detailed field-level transformation
    rules. Handle selection field value changes where options were renamed or restructured
    between versions. Transform datetime fields to include proper timezone information—Odoo
    18 enforces stricter timezone handling. Convert many2one references using external
    ID mapping tables tracking old record IDs to new system IDs.


    Cleanse data during transformation by removing test records, demo data, and obsolete
    information. Consolidate duplicate partner records using fuzzy name matching and
    VAT number comparison. Standardize address formats to match local postal conventions.
    Normalize phone numbers to international format with proper country codes. Update
    state machine values where workflow states changed between versions.


    Implement data enrichment adding information missing in source data. Calculate
    computed fields that Odoo 15 stored directly but Odoo 18 computes on-demand. Add
    default values for new required fields introduced in Odoo 18. Populate audit fields
    like create_uid and write_uid with appropriate user references.


    ### Loading Data into Odoo 18


    Implement data loaders using Odoo 18''s ORM methods like `create()` and `write()`
    for proper business logic enforcement. Process data in strict dependency order
    creating parent records before children to satisfy foreign key constraints. Use
    external IDs for reliable record identification enabling updates during migration
    reruns.


    Implement comprehensive error handling for validation failures, duplicate detection,
    and constraint violations. Log detailed error messages including record data,
    error type, and suggested fixes. Implement skip-and-continue logic allowing migrations
    to proceed despite individual record failures. Generate error reports summarizing
    all failed records for manual review.


    Create transaction batching committing every 1,000 records to balance performance
    with rollback granularity. Implement progress checkpointing enabling migration
    resume after interruptions. Monitor database performance during loading watching
    for lock contention or slow query execution. These robust loaders ensure reliable,
    resumable data insertion.


    ## Post-Migration Validation and Performance


    ### Validating Data Integrity


    Execute comprehensive validation verifying all data migrated correctly from Odoo
    15 to Odoo 18. Compare record counts for every model ensuring no data loss occurred.
    Verify financial totals including account balances, inventory valuations, and
    receivables/payables match source system. Validate relational integrity by checking
    all many2one references resolve to existing records and many2many links preserved
    correctly.


    Run business logic validation ensuring computed fields calculate correctly in
    the new system. Test workflows by creating sample transactions through complete
    business cycles. Compare report outputs between Odoo 15 and Odoo 18 for identical
    data—invoices, balance sheets, inventory reports should match. Perform statistical
    sampling reviewing 1-5% of records in detail across all critical models.


    ### Implementing Performance Optimization


    Optimize PostgreSQL for Odoo 18''s query patterns by analyzing slow queries with
    `pg_stat_statements` extension. Create indexes on frequently queried fields lacking
    proper indexing. Tune PostgreSQL configuration parameters including `shared_buffers`
    (25% of RAM), `work_mem` (calculated per worker), and `effective_cache_size` (75%
    of RAM).


    Configure Odoo worker processes based on server resources using formula: workers
    = (CPU_cores * 2) + 1. Implement proper caching strategies using Redis for session
    storage and CDN for static assets. Enable Odoo''s built-in asset optimization
    minifying JavaScript and CSS files. Configure database connection pooling using
    pgBouncer for efficient connection management.


    ### Conducting User Acceptance Testing


    Engage business users from each department validating their specific workflows
    in Odoo 18. Have sales teams test quotation creation, order processing, and customer
    management. Ask accounting staff to verify invoice generation, payment recording,
    and financial reporting. Involve warehouse personnel testing inventory operations,
    picking processes, and delivery management.


    Test edge cases and exception scenarios often missed in standard testing. Validate
    multi-currency transactions, inter-company transfers, and complex approval workflows.
    Test system behavior under load with multiple concurrent users. Collect detailed
    feedback on interface changes, performance perceptions, and functional gaps. Document
    all identified issues with severity ratings and resolution priorities.


    ### Establishing Monitoring and Maintenance


    Implement comprehensive monitoring tracking system health, performance metrics,
    and error rates. Configure Prometheus or New Relic for application performance
    monitoring. Set up log aggregation with ELK stack or Graylog for centralized troubleshooting.
    Enable PostgreSQL monitoring tracking query performance, connection counts, and
    database size growth.


    Establish alert thresholds for critical metrics including CPU usage above 80%,
    memory exhaustion, disk space below 20%, and error rate spikes. Configure notifications
    via email, Slack, or PagerDuty for immediate team response. Create health check
    endpoints monitoring critical system components and integration connectivity.


    Implement automated backup procedures with daily full database backups and continuous
    filestore synchronization. Test backup restoration regularly verifying recovery
    procedures work correctly. Document operational procedures for common maintenance
    tasks including module updates, user management, and system configuration. Plan
    regular update cycles for security patches and feature enhancements. These practices
    ensure long-term system stability and operational excellence.'
