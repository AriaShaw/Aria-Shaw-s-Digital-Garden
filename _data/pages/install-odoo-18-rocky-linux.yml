  introduction: 'Deploying Install Odoo 18 on Rocky Linux : Complete Guide doesn''t
    require enterprise budgets or vendor lock-in. Where managed Odoo hosting providers
    charge three hundred to five hundred dollars monthly for comparable infrastructure,
    {{ provider_name }} delivers production-grade virtual machines at {{ cost_estimate.monthly_total
    }} with full root access and complete data ownership.


    The technical foundation you establish today determines whether your Odoo system
    scales smoothly from ten users to one hundred, or requires disruptive infrastructure
    rebuilds when you hit performance ceilings. Configuration decisions during deployment—PostgreSQL
    tuning, worker process calculations, NGINX timeout settings—either provide growth
    headroom or create bottlenecks that demand expensive remediation later.'
  installation_guide: 'Migrating business operations from QuickBooks, Excel spreadsheets,
    NetSuite, or legacy ERP systems to Odoo requires production infrastructure ready
    before you begin data migration activities. Attempting to set up servers while
    simultaneously mapping data fields, validating import procedures, and training
    users guarantees timeline delays and increases the risk of errors that corrupt
    production data.


    Performance under load separates viable production infrastructure from systems
    that collapse during month-end financial closes or customer deadline pressure.
    The specific instance configuration in this guide delivers predictable response
    times even when users simultaneously run complex inventory calculations, generate
    financial statements, and process bulk sales orders.


    ## Server Requirements and Architecture Decisions


    Installing Odoo 18 on Rocky Linux  requires careful consideration of your architecture
    before executing installation commands. The single-server deployment documented
    here suits businesses with 10-50 concurrent users and handles typical ERP workloads—accounting,
    inventory management, CRM, sales orders—without performance degradation. If your
    team exceeds 50 users or processes high-volume transactions (e-commerce with thousands
    of daily orders, manufacturing with complex bill-of-materials calculations), you
    need separated application and database tiers from the start.


    Rocky Linux continues the CentOS tradition after Red Hat''s strategic pivot, providing
    RHEL-compatible binaries maintained by the original CentOS founder. The distribution
    prioritizes stability and enterprise features, making it ideal for businesses
    requiring long-term support without vendor lock-in. The community-driven governance
    model ensures the platform serves user needs rather than corporate agendas.


    The installation process follows a specific sequence because later steps depend
    on earlier components. PostgreSQL must exist before you create the Odoo database
    user. Python dependencies must install before you clone Odoo''s source code. System
    users must exist before you assign file ownership. Skipping steps or reordering
    them creates cryptic permission errors and missing library failures that waste
    hours of troubleshooting time.


    ## Step-by-Step Installation Walkthrough


    The deployment begins with system preparation. Connect to your server via SSH
    and update the package repositories to current versions. Rocky Linux  ships with
    PostgreSQL 15, which provides the JSON indexing and full-text search capabilities
    Odoo requires for efficient record filtering and inventory lookups. Install PostgreSQL
    first, create a dedicated database user named ''odoo'' with superuser privileges,
    and initialize an empty database that Odoo will populate during first launch.


    Python 3.11 serves as Odoo''s runtime environment. Rocky Linux''s default repositories
    include the correct version along with essential development headers and build
    tools. Install the full Python development package, not just the interpreter,
    because Odoo''s requirements include C-extension libraries like lxml and Pillow
    that compile native code during installation. Missing gcc or python-dev packages
    cause installation failures with unclear error messages.


    wkhtmltopdf handles PDF generation for invoices, reports, and shipping labels.
    Odoo embeds this external tool through system calls, so installation location
    and permissions matter. Download the version specifically packaged for Rocky Linux  from
    wkhtmltopdf.org, not your distribution''s repositories—the packaged version includes
    Qt patches that fix rendering issues with complex CSS layouts and ensure consistent
    page breaks in multi-page reports.


    Create a system user named ''odoo'' to run the application process. This dedicated
    user provides security isolation—if attackers compromise the Odoo process, they
    gain only ''odoo'' user permissions, not root access to your entire system. Configure
    this user without shell access and with a locked password, then clone Odoo''s
    source repository into /opt/odoo/odoo18/ with this user as the owner.


    The configuration file at /etc/odoo/odoo.conf contains parameters that determine
    Odoo''s runtime behavior. Set the master password (admin_passwd) to a strong random
    string—this password protects database creation, backup restoration, and module
    installation operations. Configure worker processes using the formula (CPU cores
    × 2) + 1 to balance concurrency with memory usage. Set proxy_mode = True if you''ll
    add NGINX reverse proxy later, which most production deployments require for SSL
    termination.


    The systemd service configuration ensures Odoo starts automatically after server
    reboots and restarts after crashes. Create /etc/systemd/system/odoo.service with
    proper User, Group, and ExecStart directives pointing to Odoo''s binary and configuration
    file. Enable the service with systemctl enable, then start it with systemctl start.
    Check status with systemctl status odoo—you should see "active (running)" and
    log entries showing successful database connection.


    ## Database Performance Tuning


    PostgreSQL''s default configuration optimizes for minimal memory usage, not performance.
    Your Odoo database will execute thousands of queries daily—product searches, invoice
    generation, inventory updates—and default settings leave 90% of available RAM
    unused. Edit postgresql.conf to set shared_buffers = 25% of system RAM, effective_cache_size
    = 50% of system RAM, and work_mem = 16MB for complex query optimization.


    Maintenance tasks prevent performance degradation over time. Configure PostgreSQL
    to automatically vacuum deleted records, which accumulate as users edit and delete
    transactions. Enable autovacuum with aggressive settings: autovacuum_max_workers
    = 3, autovacuum_naptime = 10 seconds. Create a weekly cron job to run REINDEX
    DATABASE on your Odoo database, which rebuilds indexes fragmented by constant
    updates.


    ## Security Hardening


    The installation creates an accessible Odoo instance on port 8069, but production
    security requires multiple layers. Install NGINX as a reverse proxy to handle
    HTTPS termination, request filtering, and rate limiting. Configure NGINX to forward
    requests from port 443 to Odoo''s port 8069, setting proxy_read_timeout to 600
    seconds—Odoo''s module installation and large report generation operations require
    several minutes to complete, and lower timeouts kill these requests prematurely.


    Let''s Encrypt provides free SSL certificates with automated renewal. Install
    Certbot, run certification for your domain, and add a cron job for automatic renewal
    every 60 days. SSL certificates expire after 90 days, but renewing at 60 days
    provides safety margin for renewal failures or network issues.


    Firewall configuration requires precision. Use UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) to
    allow SSH (port 22), HTTP (port 80), and HTTPS (port 443) inbound traffic. Block
    direct access to port 8069 from external networks—Odoo should only accept connections
    from NGINX''s localhost proxy. This prevents attackers from bypassing your reverse
    proxy''s security features and accessing Odoo''s administrative interfaces directly.


    ## Backup Strategy


    Production deployments require automated, tested backups before you add real business
    data. Install the backup script from the Fortress Protection module, which performs
    PostgreSQL dumps with compression, copies filestore attachments, and syncs backups
    to off-site storage. Schedule daily backups at 2 AM when user activity minimizes,
    and retain 30 daily backups, 12 monthly backups, and 7 yearly backups.


    Test restoration procedures within the first week. Create a test instance, restore
    yesterday''s backup, and verify all data loads correctly and modules function
    properly. Untested backups provide false security—you only discover corruption
    or missing steps when disaster strikes and recovery fails.


    ## Monitoring and Operational Visibility


    The free Odoo Health Monitor script tracks CPU usage, memory consumption, disk
    space, and PostgreSQL connection counts every 5 minutes. Configure alert thresholds
    at 80% CPU utilization and 500MB free memory—these provide early warning before
    performance degrades to user-visible levels. Log monitoring output to /var/log/odoo-health.log
    for historical analysis.


    Monitor disk space growth carefully. Odoo''s filestore directory accumulates uploaded
    attachments, generated PDFs, and cached report images. Plan for 10-20GB growth
    annually for typical SMB usage, more for document-heavy workflows. Set up alerts
    when free space drops below 20% to prevent emergency cleanups during month-end
    processing.


    ## Post-Installation Verification


    Access Odoo through your browser at https://yourdomain.com. The first-access setup
    wizard prompts for master password verification, database creation, and initial
    module selection. Install at minimum: Sales, Inventory, and Accounting for business
    operations visibility. Add Website and E-commerce if you sell online. Skip unnecessary
    modules initially—you can install them later without disrupting operations.


    Create administrative and standard user accounts immediately. Don''t use the default
    ''admin'' user for daily operations—create a personal account with limited privileges
    and reserve ''admin'' for system configuration and module installation. This separation
    prevents accidental configuration changes and provides audit trail clarity.


    The deployment time from SSH connection to operational Odoo instance takes 30-45
    minutes for experienced administrators, 60-90 minutes for first-time installations.
    This time investment establishes infrastructure that supports business operations
    for years, not months. You built a production-grade foundation that handles growth
    from ten to one hundred users without architectural rebuilds—that scalability
    and control define digital sovereignty.

  conclusion: 'The Install Odoo 18 on Rocky Linux : Complete Guide architecture you
    implemented on {{ provider_name }} provides a scaling foundation that supports
    business growth without infrastructure rebuilds. The current {{ recommended_instance.instance_type
    }} configuration handles {{ recommended_instance.recommended_for }}, but the deployment
    patterns you followed—separated application and database tiers, reverse proxy
    SSL termination, automated backup systems—scale linearly when user counts increase.


    Growth-related infrastructure changes require minimal effort because you built
    on production-grade foundations from the start. Upgrading to a larger instance
    type takes thirty minutes and involves stopping services, resizing the instance
    through {{ provider_name }}''s console, adjusting PostgreSQL parameters for the
    new RAM allocation, and restarting services. Adding a read replica for reporting
    workloads requires similar effort. Implementing high availability with load-balanced
    application servers builds on the NGINX configuration you already deployed. You
    established architectural patterns that accommodate scaling without starting over.


    Your immediate focus should shift to operational excellence. Validate your backup
    restoration process by performing a complete recovery to a test instance. Establish
    monitoring baselines for normal CPU, memory, and disk usage patterns so you can
    identify anomalies before they cause outages. Document configuration decisions
    and administrative procedures for future team members. The infrastructure work
    is complete—operational maturity and application layer optimization represent
    your next leverage points for extracting maximum value from this {{ cost_estimate.monthly_total
    }} monthly infrastructure investment.
