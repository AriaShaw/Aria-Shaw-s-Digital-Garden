  main_content: "## System Architecture and Component Stack\n\nOdoo 18 deployment\
    \ on Ubuntu 24.04 employs a multi-tier architecture that separates concerns across\
    \ specialized components. The stack leverages Ubuntu's native package management\
    \ alongside Python's virtual environment isolation. This hybrid approach balances\
    \ system stability with Odoo's specific dependency requirements. Understanding\
    \ this architecture prevents common deployment pitfalls.\n\nThe web tier centers\
    \ around Odoo's built-in HTTP server with optional Nginx reverse proxy configuration.\
    \ Odoo 18 handles HTTP requests directly but benefits from Nginx for static asset\
    \ serving and SSL termination. The application tier runs Python 3.10+ code within\
    \ a dedicated virtual environment. This isolation prevents conflicts with system\
    \ Python packages while ensuring Odoo receives exact dependency versions.\n\n\
    The data tier utilizes PostgreSQL 15+ as the exclusive database backend. Odoo\
    \ maintains persistent connections to PostgreSQL for optimal transaction performance.\
    \ The system employs connection pooling to manage database resources efficiently.\
    \ This separation allows independent scaling of application and database components\
    \ as load increases.\n\nSystem services coordinate component lifecycle through\
    \ systemd unit files. The Odoo service runs under a dedicated system user with\
    \ restricted permissions. This security model follows the principle of least privilege\
    \ while ensuring proper file access. Log aggregation collects data from all components\
    \ into centralized locations for monitoring and troubleshooting.\n\n### Process\
    \ Communication Patterns\n\nOdoo processes communicate through well-defined protocols\
    \ with specific performance characteristics. HTTP requests enter through the web\
    \ interface and route to appropriate controller methods. The framework uses Python's\
    \ multiprocessing to handle concurrent requests with configurable worker processes.\
    \ Inter-process communication occurs through shared memory for cache and session\
    \ data.\n\nLong-running operations leverage PostgreSQL's advisory locks for distributed\
    \ task coordination. The built-in job queue processes asynchronous tasks through\
    \ dedicated worker threads. Real-time notifications use WebSocket connections\
    \ for instant client updates. This multi-channel approach ensures responsive user\
    \ experience despite backend processing complexity.\n\n### Resource Allocation\
    \ Strategy\n\nMemory allocation follows a calculated formula based on available\
    \ system RAM and expected concurrent users. Each worker process consumes base\
    \ memory plus per-request overhead. The system reserves additional memory for\
    \ PostgreSQL operations and filesystem caching. Proper sizing prevents memory\
    \ exhaustion under production loads.\n\nCPU resources distribute across worker\
    \ processes with load balancing at the operating system level. The configuration\
    \ assigns workers to specific CPU cores to reduce context switching overhead.\
    \ Disk I/O prioritizes database operations with separate storage volumes for database\
    \ files and application logs. This separation prevents I/O contention between\
    \ critical components.\n\n## System Preparation and Dependency Installation \n\nUbuntu 24.04 requires specific package configuration to support Odoo\
    \ 18's runtime environment. Begin with a comprehensive system update to ensure\
    \ all security patches apply. The process installs necessary development tools\
    \ and Python environment management utilities. These foundational packages enable\
    \ subsequent Odoo-specific installation steps.\n\nExecute the system preparation\
    \ commands to establish a clean baseline. Update the package cache and upgrade\
    \ existing packages to their latest versions. Install essential build tools and\
    \ libraries that Odoo dependencies require. This preparation prevents compilation\
    \ failures during Python package installation.\n\n```bash\nsudo apt update &&\
    \ sudo apt upgrade -y\nsudo apt install -y software-properties-common curl wget\
    \ gnupg2\nsudo apt install -y build-essential python3-dev python3-pip python3-venv\n\
    sudo apt install -y libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libsasl2-dev libldap2-dev\nsudo apt\
    \ install -y libssl-dev libpq-dev libjpeg-dev libopenjp2-7-dev\n```\n\nCreate\
    \ the dedicated system user that will run Odoo processes with restricted privileges.\
    \ This user owns the application files and executes the Odoo server. The security\
    \ model isolates Odoo from other system services to limit potential attack surface.\
    \ Configure appropriate home directory permissions for the new user.\n\n```bash\n\
    sudo useradd -m -d /opt/odoo -U -r -s /bin/bash odoo\n```\n\nPostgreSQL installation\
    \ requires the official repository to ensure version compatibility with Odoo 18.\
    \ Ubuntu 24.04's default PostgreSQL packages may not meet Odoo's specific version\
    \ requirements. Add the PostgreSQL global development group repository for access\
    \ to supported versions. Install both server and client packages with development\
    \ headers.\n\n```bash\nsudo sh -c 'echo \"deb https://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt\
    \ $(lsb_release -cs)-pgdg main\" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list'\ncurl -fsSL\
    \ https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/postgresql.gpg\n\
    sudo apt update\nsudo apt install -y postgresql-16 postgresql-client-16 postgresql-server-dev-16\n\
    ```\n\nCreate the PostgreSQL user and database that will serve the Odoo instance.\
    \ The database user matches the system username for consistency. Configure appropriate\
    \ database permissions and ownership for the Odoo tables. Set client authentication\
    \ method to trust for local connections to simplify deployment.\n\n```bash\nsudo\
    \ -u postgres createuser --createdb --username postgres --no-createrole --no-superuser\
    \ --no-password odoo\nsudo -u postgres createdb --owner=odoo odoo\n```\n\n###\
    \ Python Environment Configuration\n\nEstablish an isolated Python environment\
    \ using the system's Python 3.10+ interpreter. The virtual environment contains\
    \ all Odoo dependencies without affecting system packages. This isolation prevents\
    \ version conflicts with other Python applications on the server. Activate the\
    \ environment before installing Odoo requirements.\n\n```bash\nsudo -u odoo python3\
    \ -m venv /opt/odoo/venv\n```\n\nInstall Wheel package first to ensure proper\
    \ binary package installation. This optimization accelerates subsequent dependency\
    \ installation by compiling C extensions. The process uses pip within the virtual\
    \ environment to manage all Python packages.\n\n```bash\nsudo -u odoo /opt/odoo/venv/bin/pip\
    \ install wheel\n```\n\nDownload Odoo 18 source code from the official repository\
    \ using the specific release branch. This approach ensures version stability compared\
    \ to development branches. Clone the repository into the Odoo user's home directory\
    \ with proper ownership.\n\n```bash\nsudo -u odoo git clone https://github.com/odoo/odoo.git\
    \ /opt/odoo/odoo-18 --branch 18.0 --depth 1\n```\n\nInstall Odoo Python dependencies\
    \ from the requirements file using the virtual environment's pip. This file contains\
    \ exact version specifications for all necessary packages. The installation process\
    \ compiles native extensions for optimal performance.\n\n```bash\nsudo -u odoo\
    \ /opt/odoo/venv/bin/pip install -r /opt/odoo/odoo-18/requirements.txt\n```\n\n\
    ### Node.js and Build Tools\n\nOdoo's web client requires Node.js for asset compilation\
    \ and management. Install Node.js from the official repositories to ensure version\
    \ compatibility. The build process uses npm to install frontend dependencies and\
    \ compile stylesheets.\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install -y nodejs npm\nsudo npm install\
    \ -g rtlcss\n```\n\nVerify proper installation of all components before proceeding\
    \ to Odoo configuration. Test Python environment accessibility and PostgreSQL\
    \ connectivity. Confirm that all system services start without errors.\n\n```bash\n\
    sudo -u odoo /opt/odoo/venv/bin/python3 --version\nsudo -u postgres psql -c \"\
    SELECT version();\"\n```\n\n## Odoo Configuration and Service Setup\n\nOdoo 18\
    \ requires careful configuration file setup to define runtime behavior and system\
    \ integration. Create the main configuration file with appropriate permissions\
    \ in the Odoo user's home directory. This file controls database connections,\
    \ module paths, and server behavior. Use minimal settings for initial deployment\
    \ with expansion for production requirements.\n\nCreate the configuration directory\
    \ and file with secure permissions. The Odoo user must have read access while\
    \ preventing unauthorized modification. Set strict file permissions to protect\
    \ database credentials and other sensitive settings.\n\n```bash\nsudo mkdir /etc/odoo\n\
    sudo touch /etc/odoo/odoo.conf\nsudo chown odoo:odoo /etc/odoo/odoo.conf\nsudo\
    \ chmod 640 /etc/odoo/odoo.conf\n```\n\nPopulate the configuration file with essential\
    \ settings for basic operation. Include database connection parameters, addon\
    \ paths, and logging configuration. These settings establish the foundation for\
    \ Odoo operation.\n\n```ini\n[options]\nadmin_passwd = superadmin_secret_password\n\
    db_host = localhost\ndb_port = 5432\ndb_user = odoo\ndb_password = False\naddons_path\
    \ = /opt/odoo/odoo-18/addons\nlogfile = /var/log/odoo/odoo.log\nlog_level = info\n\
    ```\n\nThe admin_passwd parameter secures the database management interface with\
    \ a strong password. Never use default credentials in production environments.\
    \ The db_password setting remains False when using peer authentication, which\
    \ leverages system user identity for database access.\n\n### Systemd Service Configuration\n\
    \nCreate a systemd service file to manage Odoo as a persistent system service.\
    \ This approach provides automatic startup, process monitoring, and log integration.\
    \ The service definition specifies execution environment, user context, and startup\
    \ parameters.\n\nCreate the service file in the systemd directory with proper\
    \ syntax. Define the service unit with dependency ordering and process management\
    \ directives. The service should start after PostgreSQL to ensure database availability.\n\
    \n```bash\nsudo nano /etc/systemd/system/odoo.service\n```\n\nConfigure the service\
    \ with explicit execution paths and user context. The service runs under the Odoo\
    \ user with the virtual environment activated. Systemd manages process lifecycle\
    \ and restarts the service on failure.\n\n```ini\n[Unit]\nDescription=Odoo 18\n\
    After=postgresql.service\n\n[Service]\nType=simple\nUser=odoo\nGroup=odoo\nExecStart=/opt/odoo/venv/bin/python3\
    \ /opt/odoo/odoo-18/odoo-bin -c /etc/odoo/odoo.conf\nKillMode=mixed\nRestart=on-failure\n\
    RestartSec=5\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n```\n\nCreate the log directory\
    \ with proper ownership for Odoo logging. The service writes application logs\
    \ to this directory for troubleshooting and monitoring. Set appropriate permissions\
    \ to allow the Odoo user to create log files.\n\n```bash\nsudo mkdir /var/log/odoo\n\
    sudo chown odoo:odoo /var/log/odoo\n```\n\nEnable and start the Odoo service using\
    \ systemctl commands. Verify successful service startup through status checks\
    \ and log examination. The service should respond without errors and begin accepting\
    \ connections.\n\n```bash\nsudo systemctl enable odoo\nsudo systemctl start odoo\n\
    sudo systemctl status odoo\n```\n\n### Nginx Reverse Proxy Configuration\n\nConfigure\
    \ Nginx as a reverse proxy to handle HTTP requests and serve static files. This\
    \ setup improves performance and enables SSL termination. Create a new Nginx server\
    \ block dedicated to Odoo traffic.\n\nInstall Nginx from Ubuntu repositories and\
    \ create the configuration file. The server block proxies dynamic requests to\
    \ Odoo while serving static files directly. This separation reduces load on the\
    \ Python application server.\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install -y nginx\nsudo nano\
    \ /etc/nginx/sites-available/odoo\n```\n\nDefine the server block with proxy settings\
    \ and static file locations. Configure appropriate timeouts and buffer sizes for\
    \ Odoo's operation. The setup includes WebSocket proxy support for real-time features.\n\
    \n```nginx\nserver {\n    listen 80;\n    server_name your-domain.com;\n    \n\
    \    location / {\n        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8069;\n        proxy_set_header\
    \ Host $host;\n        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;\n        proxy_set_header\
    \ X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;\n        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto\
    \ $scheme;\n    }\n    \n    location /longpolling {\n        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8072;\n\
    \    }\n    \n    location ~* /web/static/ {\n        proxy_cache_valid 200 60m;\n\
    \        proxy_buffering on;\n        expires 864000;\n        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8069;\n\
    \    }\n}\n```\n\nEnable the site configuration and test Nginx syntax. Reload\
    \ Nginx to apply the new configuration. Verify proxy functionality by accessing\
    \ Odoo through the Nginx server.\n\n```bash\nsudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/odoo\
    \ /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/\nsudo nginx -t\nsudo systemctl reload nginx\n```\n\
    \n## Database Configuration and Optimization\n\nPostgreSQL tuning significantly\
    \ impacts Odoo performance, especially under concurrent user loads. Ubuntu 24.04's\
    \ default PostgreSQL configuration requires adjustment for production Odoo deployments.\
    \ The tuning process balances memory allocation, connection management, and query\
    \ optimization.\n\nModify PostgreSQL's main configuration file to allocate resources\
    \ based on available system memory. The shared_buffers setting should allocate\
    \ approximately 25% of total RAM for database caching. The work_mem parameter\
    \ controls per-operation memory for sorting and hashing operations. These settings\
    \ prevent disk-based operations that degrade performance.\n\nEdit the PostgreSQL\
    \ configuration file to apply performance optimizations. Locate the postgresql.conf\
    \ file in the PostgreSQL data directory. Adjust memory settings and connection\
    \ parameters based on your server's capacity.\n\n```bash\nsudo nano /etc/postgresql/16/main/postgresql.conf\n\
    ```\n\nApply key performance settings for Odoo workloads. Increase shared buffers\
    \ for better cache performance and adjust work memory for complex operations.\
    \ Set effective cache size to help the query planner make better decisions.\n\n\
    ```ini\nshared_buffers = 2GB\nwork_mem = 32MB\neffective_cache_size = 6GB\nmaintenance_work_mem\
    \ = 512MB\ncheckpoint_completion_target = 0.9\nwal_buffers = 16MB\ndefault_statistics_target\
    \ = 500\nmax_connections = 80\n```\n\nConfigure connection pooling with pgBouncer\
    \ to manage database connections efficiently. Odoo creates persistent database\
    \ connections that can exhaust PostgreSQL's connection limits under load. pgBouncer\
    \ maintains a connection pool and shares connections among multiple Odoo workers.\n\
    \nInstall pgBouncer from Ubuntu repositories and configure the pool settings.\
    \ The pool mode should use transaction pooling for Odoo's connection pattern.\
    \ Set appropriate pool sizes based on your Odoo worker configuration.\n\n```bash\n\
    sudo apt install -y pgbouncer\nsudo nano /etc/pgbouncer/pgbouncer.ini\n```\n\n\
    Define the database connection parameters and pool behavior. Configure authentication\
    \ to match your PostgreSQL setup. The pool configuration should match Odoo's database\
    \ connection requirements.\n\n```ini\n[databases]\nodoo = host=localhost port=5432\
    \ dbname=odoo\n\n[pgbouncer]\npool_mode = transaction\nmax_client_conn = 100\n\
    default_pool_size = 25\n```\n\nUpdate Odoo's configuration to use pgBouncer instead\
    \ of direct PostgreSQL connections. Change the database host and port to point\
    \ to the pgBouncer instance. This redirects all database traffic through the connection\
    \ pool.\n\n```ini\ndb_host = localhost\ndb_port = 6432\n```\n\n### Database Maintenance\
    \ Strategy\n\nImplement regular database maintenance to prevent performance degradation\
    \ over time. Schedule vacuum and analyze operations during low-usage periods.\
    \ These operations update table statistics and reclaim storage from deleted records.\n\
    \nCreate a maintenance script that performs essential database operations. The\
    \ script should run during off-hours to minimize user impact. Include vacuum,\
    \ reindex, and statistics update commands.\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\nsudo -u postgres\
    \ vacuumdb --analyze --all\nsudo -u postgres reindexdb --all\n```\n\nConfigure\
    \ automated backups to protect against data loss. Use PostgreSQL's built-in backup\
    \ tools with appropriate retention policies. Test restoration procedures regularly\
    \ to ensure backup validity.\n\n```bash\nsudo -u postgres pg_dump odoo > /backups/odoo-$(date\
    \ +%Y%m%d).sql\n```\n\n## Security Hardening and Access Control\n\nOdoo 18 deployment\
    \ on Ubuntu 24.04 demands rigorous security measures to protect business data.\
    \ The configuration must address network exposure, application vulnerabilities,\
    \ and data protection. A layered security approach minimizes attack surface while\
    \ maintaining functionality.\n\nConfigure firewall rules to restrict access to\
    \ essential services only. Ubuntu's UFW firewall provides simple management of\
    \ iptables rules. Allow only HTTP, HTTPS, and SSH traffic by default. Block all\
    \ other incoming connections to reduce exposure.\n\n```bash\nsudo ufw allow ssh\n\
    sudo ufw allow 80/tcp\nsudo ufw allow 443/tcp\nsudo ufw enable\n```\n\nImplement\
    \ fail2ban to protect against brute force attacks on authentication endpoints.\
    \ Fail2ban monitors log files and automatically blocks IP addresses with suspicious\
    \ activity. Configure specific jails for Odoo login attempts and PostgreSQL connections.\n\
    \nInstall fail2ban and create custom filters for Odoo authentication patterns.\
    \ The service should detect repeated failed login attempts and implement temporary\
    \ bans. This protection prevents credential stuffing attacks.\n\n```bash\nsudo\
    \ apt install -y fail2ban\nsudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local\n```\n\nDefine Odoo-specific\
    \ jails with appropriate ban times and retry limits. The configuration should\
    \ balance security with legitimate user access. Monitor fail2ban logs to tune\
    \ detection sensitivity.\n\n```ini\n[odoo]\nenabled = true\nport = 8069,8072\n\
    filter = odoo\nlogpath = /var/log/odoo/odoo.log\nmaxretry = 5\nbantime = 3600\n\
    ```\n\n### Application Security Configuration\n\nHarden Odoo's security settings\
    \ through configuration parameters and system-level protections. Enable strong\
    \ password policies for user accounts. Configure session timeout values to prevent\
    \ unauthorized access from unattended workstations.\n\nModify Odoo configuration\
    \ to implement security best practices. Set appropriate parameters for database\
    \ filtering and XML-RPC protection. These settings prevent common attack vectors\
    \ against Odoo instances.\n\n```ini\nlist_db = False\ndb_filter = ^odoo$\nproxy_mode\
    \ = True\nx_sendfile = True\n```\n\nImplement SSL/TLS encryption for all web traffic\
    \ using Let's Encrypt certificates. The Certbot tool automates certificate issuance\
    \ and renewal. Configure Nginx to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS endpoints.\n\n\
    ```bash\nsudo apt install -y certbot python3-certbot-nginx\nsudo certbot --nginx\
    \ -d your-domain.com\n```\n\n### System Hardening Measures\n\nApply operating\
    \ system security updates regularly through automated patch management. Configure\
    \ unattended-upgrades to install security patches without manual intervention.\
    \ Monitor security advisories for Ubuntu and PostgreSQL vulnerabilities.\n\n```bash\n\
    sudo apt install -y unattended-upgrades\nsudo dpkg-reconfigure -plow unattended-upgrades\n\
    ```\n\nConfigure file system permissions to restrict access to configuration files\
    \ and data directories. The Odoo user should have minimal privileges required\
    \ for application operation. Regular security audits verify permission compliance.\n\
    \n```bash\nsudo chmod 750 /opt/odoo\nsudo chmod 640 /etc/odoo/odoo.conf\n```\n\
    \n## Performance Monitoring and Optimization\n\nOdoo 18 performance monitoring\
    \ requires comprehensive metric collection across all system components. The monitoring\
    \ strategy covers application response times, database performance, and system\
    \ resource utilization. Proactive monitoring identifies bottlenecks before they\
    \ impact users.\n\nImplement structured logging with appropriate log levels for\
    \ different environments. Production systems should use INFO level logging with\
    \ WARNING for third-party modules. Configure log rotation to prevent disk space\
    \ exhaustion from growing log files.\n\nModify Odoo's logging configuration to\
    \ capture performance metrics. The log format should include timestamps and request\
    \ identifiers for correlation. Structured logging enables automated analysis of\
    \ performance patterns.\n\n```ini\nlog_handler = :INFO\nlog_db = False\nlog_level\
    \ = warn:odoo.addons.auth_signup\n```\n\nSet up system monitoring with Prometheus\
    \ and Grafana for visualization. The Node Exporter collects system metrics while\
    \ custom exporters monitor Odoo-specific performance indicators. Grafana dashboards\
    \ provide real-time visibility into system health.\n\nInstall Prometheus node\
    \ exporter to collect system-level metrics. The exporter provides CPU, memory,\
    \ disk, and network utilization data. These metrics help correlate Odoo performance\
    \ with system resource constraints.\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install -y prometheus-node-exporter\n\
    ```\n\n### Database Performance Monitoring\n\nMonitor PostgreSQL performance through\
    \ built-in statistics views and external tools. The pg_stat_statements extension\
    \ tracks query performance across the database instance. Identify slow queries\
    \ that require optimization through index creation or query rewriting.\n\nEnable\
    \ PostgreSQL performance monitoring extensions and configure statistics collection.\
    \ The setup provides visibility into query execution times and resource consumption.\
    \ Regular review of these statistics guides performance tuning efforts.\n\n```sql\n\
    CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_statements;\n```\n\nConfigure Odoo worker processes based\
    \ on system resources and expected load. The worker calculation formula considers\
    \ available CPU cores and RAM capacity. Over-provisioning workers causes memory\
    \ exhaustion while under-provisioning limits concurrency.\n\nCalculate optimal\
    \ worker count using the standard formula for your hardware. Consider both CPU-bound\
    \ and I/O-bound operation characteristics. Monitor worker performance and adjust\
    \ based on actual usage patterns.\n\n```ini\nworkers = 8\nmax_cron_threads = 2\n\
    limit_memory_hard = 2684354560\nlimit_memory_soft = 2147483648\nlimit_request\
    \ = 8192\nlimit_time_cpu = 600\nlimit_time_real = 1200\n```\n\n### Caching Strategy\
    \ Implementation\n\nConfigure Redis as a caching backend for Odoo sessions and\
    \ frequently accessed data. Redis caching reduces database load and improves response\
    \ times for common operations. The cache stores user sessions, translated terms,\
    \ and computed values.\n\nInstall Redis server and configure Odoo to use it for\
    \ caching. The setup requires proper memory allocation and eviction policies to\
    \ prevent cache exhaustion. Monitor cache hit rates to measure effectiveness.\n\
    \n```bash\nsudo apt install -y redis-server\n```\n\nAdd Redis configuration to\
    \ Odoo for session storage and cache management. The setup distributes cache across\
    \ multiple worker processes while maintaining consistency. Proper cache invalidation\
    \ ensures data accuracy.\n\n```ini\nsession_redis = True\nredis_host = localhost\n\
    redis_port = 6379\nredis_db = 1\n```\n\n## Backup and Disaster Recovery Procedures\n\nComprehensive backup strategies protect Odoo deployment from data loss and\
    \ system failures. The backup approach must cover database content, filestore\
    \ data, and configuration files. A tested restoration procedure ensures business\
    \ continuity after incidents.\n\nImplement automated database backups using PostgreSQL's\
    \ continuous archiving and point-in-time recovery. This method captures all database\
    \ changes with minimal performance impact. Combine full backups with WAL file\
    \ archiving for complete data protection.\n\nConfigure PostgreSQL archive mode\
    \ to enable continuous backup operations. The setup requires dedicated storage\
    \ for archived WAL files and base backups. Monitor archive operations to ensure\
    \ backup consistency.\n\n```ini\nwal_level = replica\narchive_mode = on\narchive_command\
    \ = 'test ! -f /backups/wal/%f && cp %p /backups/wal/%f'\n```\n\nSchedule regular\
    \ full database backups during low-usage periods. The backup process should include\
    \ verification steps to ensure data integrity. Test restoration procedures monthly\
    \ to validate backup effectiveness.\n\nCreate a backup script that performs database\
    \ dump and filestore synchronization. The script should include error handling\
    \ and notification for backup failures. Secure backup storage prevents unauthorized\
    \ access to sensitive business data.\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\nsudo -u odoo pg_dump\
    \ odoo > /backups/odoo-$(date +%Y%m%d).sql\nrsync -av /opt/odoo/odoo-18/filestore\
    \ /backups/filestore-$(date +%Y%m%d)\n```\n\n### System Configuration Backup\n\
    \nBackup Odoo configuration files, custom modules, and system service definitions.\
    \ These components require protection alongside database content. Version control\
    \ systems manage custom code changes and configuration revisions.\n\nStore configuration\
    \ backups in a secure location separate from the production server. The backup\
    \ set should enable complete system reconstruction in case of catastrophic failure.\
    \ Document restoration procedures for disaster recovery scenarios.\n\nImplement\
    \ backup rotation policies to manage storage utilization. Retain daily backups\
    \ for one week, weekly backups for one month, and monthly backups for one year.\
    \ This strategy balances storage costs with recovery flexibility.\n\nMonitor backup\
    \ operations through centralized logging and alerting. Failed backups should trigger\
    \ immediate notifications to system administrators. Regular backup reports verify\
    \ protection coverage and identify gaps.\n\nTest disaster recovery procedures\
    \ through periodic restoration exercises. The tests validate both technical recovery\
    \ capabilities and operational procedures. Update documentation based on lessons\
    \ learned from recovery tests."
