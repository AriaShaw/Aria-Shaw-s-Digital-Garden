  main_content: '## Pre-Migration Assessment and Planning


    **Inventory Your Current Odoo 13 Environment**


    Start with a complete audit of your existing installation. Document all installed
    modules, both standard and custom. Create a detailed spreadsheet listing every
    module name, version number, and purpose within your business operations. List
    every third-party application and integration point with external systems. Record
    your server specifications including CPU cores, RAM allocation, disk space usage,
    and database size in megabytes. This inventory forms your migration baseline and
    identifies potential risk areas.


    Examine your current data volumes across critical models. Count partner records,
    product items, sales orders, invoices, and inventory moves. Review your customizations
    to identify which custom features your business requires in Odoo 18. Some functions
    may now exist in standard Odoo 18 modules, eliminating the need for custom code.
    This analysis often reveals opportunities to simplify your system during the upgrade.


    **Analyze Custom Code and Dependencies**


    Review all custom modules for Odoo 18 compatibility with a systematic code audit.
    The framework evolved significantly between these versions, with major changes
    to the ORM, web client, and reporting systems. Check your Python code for deprecated
    methods and APIs that no longer exist in the new version. Examine your XML views
    for syntax changes, particularly in form views and tree structures. Identify JavaScript
    code that uses the old web client framework and needs conversion to the new architecture.


    Create a module migration complexity matrix that categorizes each custom module
    as low, medium, or high complexity for the upgrade. Low complexity modules need
    only manifest updates and minor Python tweaks. Medium complexity modules require
    view restructuring and moderate code changes. High complexity modules need complete
    rewrites due to fundamental framework changes. This analysis determines your development
    workload for the migration project and helps estimate time requirements.


    **Establish Migration Scope and Timeline**


    Define which data sets and functions move to the new system with clear inclusion
    criteria. Decide if you migrate all historical data or only active records from
    the past 24 months. Determine whether to archive old completed transactions or
    maintain them for regulatory compliance. Set a realistic timeline with key milestones
    that account for testing phases and stakeholder review periods. Allocate dedicated
    testing periods for each module group to identify issues early.


    Plan the final cut-over during low business activity, such as month-end after
    financial close or during a scheduled holiday period. Build in buffer time for
    unexpected challenges that always arise during complex migrations. Communicate
    this schedule to all stakeholders in your organization, from executive leadership
    to end users who depend on system availability.


    **Assemble Your Migration Team**


    Gather technical staff who understand your Odoo implementation from both development
    and operations perspectives. Include experienced Odoo developers for code adaptation
    and system administrators for infrastructure management. Assign business users
    from each department to validate functional area migrations - you need accounting
    staff for financial modules, warehouse managers for inventory, and sales managers
    for CRM validation.


    Designate a project manager to coordinate the entire effort and serve as the single
    point of contact for status updates. Ensure this team has dedicated time for migration
    tasks, not just added responsibilities on top of current workloads. Schedule daily
    stand-up meetings during critical migration phases to maintain coordination and
    quickly address blockers.


    ## Data Migration Strategy and Execution


    **Extract and Transform Legacy Data**


    Develop Python scripts to extract data from your Odoo 13 database with proper
    error handling and logging. Use Odoo''s export functions for smaller datasets
    or direct SQL queries for large tables containing hundreds of thousands of records.
    Map each field from the old structure to the new Odoo 18 schema, accounting for
    field name changes and data type modifications introduced in the new version.


    Transform data formats where necessary, like converting date fields from DD/MM/YYYY
    to ISO 8601 format or updating selection field values that changed between versions.
    Handle custom fields by creating corresponding fields in the new system before
    migration, using Odoo Studio or manual model extensions. Test your transformation
    logic on sample datasets before processing production data to identify conversion
    issues early.


    **Execute Staged Data Migration**


    Migrate base data first, like product categories, partner classifications, and
    user accounts. These foundational records have no dependencies and establish the
    framework for subsequent data. Move transactional data like sales orders and invoices
    in subsequent phases after base data validation completes. Use Odoo''s data import
    mechanisms for structured CSV files or custom ORM scripts for complex hierarchical
    data that requires relationship preservation.


    Process data in batches of 500-1000 records to monitor performance and catch
    errors without losing entire datasets. Implement progress logging that tracks
    which records successfully migrated and which encountered errors. Validate each
    batch before proceeding to the next data set by running count comparisons and
    spot-checking sample records. This staged approach allows you to fix issues incrementally
    rather than discovering problems after migrating millions of records.


    **Handle Data Relationships and Integrity**


    Preserve relationship integrity between records during migration by maintaining
    careful ID mapping tables. Map old record IDs to new IDs for all related fields,
    storing these mappings in a separate reference table for troubleshooting. Process
    hierarchical data like product categories in the correct dependency order, migrating
    parent categories before child categories to avoid foreign key constraint violations.


    Maintain payment-term associations with customer accounts and validate that credit
    limits, payment terms, and pricing rules transfer correctly. Ensure all foreign
    key constraints resolve correctly in the new environment by running referential
    integrity checks after each migration batch. Address orphaned records that reference
    deleted or non-migrated parent records through manual data cleanup or intelligent
    default assignment.


    **Verify Data Completeness and Accuracy**


    Run comparison reports between old and new systems using SQL queries that compare
    record counts, sum totals, and data distributions. Check record counts for each
    major data model with queries like "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM res_partner WHERE active=TRUE"
    to ensure no data loss occurred. Spot-check individual records for field-level
    accuracy by reviewing high-value transactions and critical customer accounts manually.


    Validate financial balances match between general ledgers by comparing trial balance
    reports from both systems. Confirm inventory quantities transfer correctly and
    match between warehouse locations. Run reconciliation scripts that identify discrepancies
    in account balances, inventory valuations, and accounts receivable aging. Fix
    any discrepancies before proceeding to functional testing by investigating root
    causes and correcting either migration scripts or source data issues.


    ## Module Configuration and Customization


    **Configure Standard Odoo 18 Modules**


    Install and set up Odoo 18''s standard applications first, starting with base
    modules like Contacts and Inventory. The new version introduces updated workflows
    in sales order processing, inventory replenishment rules, and accounting journal
    entry creation. Explore new features like the enhanced website builder with drag-and-drop
    page construction and improved e-commerce product variant management. Configure
    settings according to your business processes, adapting where Odoo 18''s standard
    workflows offer improvements over your custom approaches.


    Review the new spreadsheet view functionality for data analysis without exporting
    to Excel. Configure the enhanced project management tools that include Gantt charts
    and resource allocation views. Adapt your procedures to leverage Odoo 18''s improved
    capabilities where possible, documenting these process changes for user training
    materials.


    **Upgrade Custom Modules for Odoo 18 Compatibility**


    Rewrite custom modules using Odoo 18''s API and framework changes, starting with
    the manifest file that now requires a license field. Update Python code to use
    the new ORM methods, replacing deprecated api.one decorators with proper recordset
    operations. Convert compute methods to use the new dependency declaration syntax
    that improves performance through better caching.


    Modify XML views to match the updated frontend architecture, particularly form
    views that now use different widget names and attributes. Update field attributes
    like invisible and readonly to use the new domain syntax instead of Python evaluations.
    Adapt JavaScript components from the old web client to the new OWL framework,
    which represents a fundamental shift in frontend architecture. This conversion
    often requires complete rewrites of custom widgets and client-side business logic.


    Test each custom module in isolation before integrating with other systems by
    creating a minimal test database with just the module under test. Use Odoo''s
    built-in testing framework to automate validation of your custom business logic.
    Verify that your custom modules don''t conflict with standard Odoo functionality
    through integration testing that exercises common workflows.


    **Implement New Odoo 18 Features**


    Identify opportunities to use Odoo 18''s new capabilities to replace custom code
    you previously maintained. The Odoo Studio module allows customizations without
    code development, enabling business users to create custom fields, modify views,
    and build simple workflows through a point-and-click interface. The new accounting
    reports provide better financial insights with drill-down capabilities and dynamic
    filtering that may eliminate custom report modules.


    The upgraded point-of-sale system offers improved retail operations with offline
    capabilities and faster transaction processing. Evaluate the new manufacturing
    module enhancements for better bill-of-materials management and work order tracking.
    Integrate these features to reduce your reliance on custom solutions that require
    ongoing maintenance.


    **Configure User Access and Security**


    Recreate user groups and access rights in Odoo 18 with the enhanced security
    model that provides finer permission control. The new version separates read,
    write, create, and delete permissions more granularly than Odoo 13. Define record
    rules for data segregation across departments, ensuring sales team A cannot see
    sales team B''s opportunities and quotes.


    Set up multi-company structures if your organization requires them, taking advantage
    of improved inter-company transaction handling. Configure two-factor authentication
    for improved security, particularly for users with administrative privileges or
    access to financial data. Implement the new password policy settings that enforce
    complexity requirements and password rotation schedules. Review and update field-level
    access controls that determine which user groups can view or modify specific fields
    on forms.


    ## System Integration and Interface Updates


    **Reestablish Third-Party Integrations**


    Update all API connections to work with Odoo 18''s web services, which now support
    improved JSON-RPC endpoints alongside the traditional XML-RPC. The new version
    uses updated authentication mechanisms including API keys that replace the old
    username/password approach for external integrations. Modify integration code
    to handle changed data models where field names or structures evolved between
    versions.


    Update webhook configurations to use the new event triggering system that offers
    more granular control over when external systems receive notifications. Test each
    connection with the external systems in development environments before exposing
    production data. Implement proper error handling for integration failures that
    logs issues and provides retry mechanisms for transient network problems.


    **Revamp User Interfaces and Experiences**


    Odoo 18 introduces a completely redesigned user interface with a modern look based
    on Material Design principles. The new interface uses a different menu structure
    and navigation paradigm that requires user retraining. Train your team on the
    new navigation patterns and layout through hands-on sessions that let them explore
    the interface before go-live.


    Customize dashboards to show relevant KPIs for each role using the improved dashboard
    builder that supports more widget types. Create role-specific home screens for
    sales representatives, warehouse workers, and accounting staff. Adapt existing
    workflows to the new interface conventions, updating written procedures and job
    aids that reference specific menu paths or button locations.


    Optimize the mobile experience for users who need field access, testing the responsive
    views on actual mobile devices rather than just desktop browser resizing. The
    new mobile interface offers improved touch controls and offline capabilities that
    benefit field service technicians and warehouse staff.


    **Update Reporting and Analytics Configuration**


    Recreate your custom reports in Odoo 18''s updated reporting engine, which uses
    a new templating system for PDF generation. The new version offers improved Business
    Intelligence tools with the spreadsheet view that provides Excel-like pivot table
    functionality directly within Odoo. Migrate your data analysis pipelines to use
    the new Odoo BI modules that integrate with the core database for real-time analytics.


    Configure automated report distribution to stakeholders using the enhanced scheduled
    actions that support more complex trigger conditions. Set up real-time dashboards
    for operational monitoring using the new dashboard framework that supports live
    data updates without page refreshes.


    **Implement Data Archiving Strategy**


    Decide which historical data to move to archive storage based on business need
    and regulatory requirements. Odoo 18 provides better tools for managing large
    datasets through the new archiving functionality built into standard models. Archive
    old completed transactions that you need for compliance but not daily operations,
    freeing up database space and improving query performance.


    This approach improves system performance for active users by reducing the dataset
    sizes for common queries and reports. Establish procedures for retrieving archived
    data when necessary through the Odoo interface or direct database queries for
    audit purposes.


    ## Testing and Quality Assurance


    **Develop Comprehensive Test Plans**


    Create detailed test cases for every critical business process in your Odoo system,
    organized by module and business function. Include both happy path scenarios where
    everything works correctly and error condition tests that verify proper handling
    of invalid data or unusual situations. Cover all modules from sales quotation
    through invoice payment, from purchase requisition through vendor payment, and
    from manufacturing order through finished goods receipt.


    Design integration tests that span multiple functional areas, such as testing
    a complete order-to-cash cycle that touches sales, inventory, accounting, and
    payment modules. Document expected results for each test case with specific values,
    screen layouts, and system behaviors. Assign each test case to appropriate business
    users who understand the process being validated.


    **Execute Multi-Stage Testing Protocol**


    Begin with unit tests for custom code and configuration changes that verify individual
    functions work correctly in isolation. Use Odoo''s built-in test framework to
    automate these unit tests and run them as part of your continuous integration
    pipeline. Progress to integration testing between modules that validates data
    flows correctly across module boundaries and related records maintain proper relationships.


    Conduct user acceptance testing with actual business users who perform their daily
    tasks in the test environment. Have users process real-world scenarios like creating
    sales orders from actual customer requests or processing vendor invoices from
    your current vendor backlog. Perform load testing to verify system performance
    under stress by simulating multiple concurrent users performing typical operations.
    Run security tests to identify potential vulnerabilities in custom code or configuration
    by attempting common attack vectors like SQL injection or privilege escalation.


    **Validate Data Integrity and Business Logic**


    Verify that all migrated data appears correctly in the new system by running validation
    queries that check for missing records, incorrect values, or broken relationships.
    Test critical business rules like inventory valuation methods that calculate cost
    of goods sold correctly. Confirm financial calculations match your accounting
    standards by running parallel processes in both the old and new systems and comparing
    results.


    Check that workflow automation triggers appropriately when status changes occur
    or time thresholds pass. Ensure compliance requirements continue to be met by
    validating that audit trail functionality captures all required transaction details
    and user actions.


    **Coordinate User Acceptance Testing**


    Involve end-users from each department in the testing process through structured
    testing sessions with clear objectives. Provide training on Odoo 18''s new interface
    and features before testing begins so users can focus on validating business logic
    rather than learning navigation. Gather feedback on usability and workflow efficiency
    using structured feedback forms that capture specific issues and improvement suggestions.


    Document any issues or requested changes in a tracking system with proper categorization
    by severity and business impact. Obtain formal sign-off from business process
    owners before go-live through documented approval that confirms the system meets
    business requirements.


    ## Deployment and Go-Live Strategy


    **Prepare Production Environment**


    Provision servers that meet Odoo 18''s increased system requirements, which typically
    demand more CPU and RAM than Odoo 13 due to framework enhancements. The new version
    requires PostgreSQL 12 or higher and Python 3.8 or later, so plan for these dependency
    upgrades. Install the Odoo 18 software and all required dependencies following
    best practices for production deployments including separate database and application
    servers for larger installations.


    Configure the database cluster for optimal performance with appropriate connection
    pool settings and memory allocation based on your expected concurrent user count.
    Set up monitoring and alerting systems for the new environment using tools like
    Prometheus and Grafana for metrics collection or commercial monitoring solutions.
    Configure system and application log aggregation to centralize troubleshooting
    and performance analysis.


    **Execute Final Data Synchronization**


    Plan a final data sync just before switching to the new system that captures all
    changes made since your last test migration. Determine how to handle transactions
    during the cut-over period, either by freezing the old system or accepting a period
    where some data requires manual transfer. For minimal downtime, implement a phased
    approach with read-only modes that let users view data but not create new transactions
    during the migration window.


    Have a detailed rollback plan if critical issues emerge that prevent successful
    go-live, including criteria for deciding to abort and documented steps to restore
    the old system to full operation. Communicate the transition schedule to all users
    through multiple channels including email announcements, intranet posts, and department
    meetings. Provide specific details about when the old system shuts down, how long
    the migration window lasts, and when the new system becomes available.


    **Manage the Go-Live Transition**


    Switch users to the new system according to your deployment plan, which might
    involve department-by-department rollout or all-at-once cutover depending on your
    approach. Provide immediate support during the initial transition period through
    a dedicated help desk with extended hours staffed by team members trained on common
    issues. Monitor system performance and error logs closely during the first few
    days, watching for unusual patterns or recurring errors that indicate systemic
    problems.


    Have technical staff available to resolve issues quickly, including developers
    who can fix bugs in custom code and system administrators who can address infrastructure
    problems. Keep the old system available temporarily in read-only mode for reference
    and data verification, allowing users to check historical data if questions arise
    about migration accuracy.


    **Post-Migration Support and Optimization**


    Address any user questions or system issues that arise after go-live through a
    structured triage process that prioritizes critical problems. Gather feedback
    on system performance and user experience through surveys, focus groups, and one-on-one
    interviews with power users. Fine-tune configurations based on actual usage patterns
    revealed through system metrics and user feedback.


    Monitor system metrics to identify areas for improvement like slow-running reports
    or frequently accessed data that benefits from additional database indexes. Plan
    ongoing training sessions for advanced features that users didn''t need immediately
    but provide value as they become more comfortable with the system. Schedule regular
    optimization reviews monthly for the first quarter after go-live to continuously
    improve system performance and user satisfaction.'
