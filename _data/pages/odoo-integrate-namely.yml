  introduction: 'Your Namely HR data lives in a separate universe from your Odoo 18
    operations. This division creates a constant manual battle. Your finance team
    chases payroll adjustments because time-off records never sync. Your managers
    lack real-time visibility into team costs because employee data stays stuck in
    HR silos. Every new hire requires duplicate data entry across three departments,
    wasting hours and introducing errors that ripple through your entire business.
    These manual handoffs between systems consume valuable time and create compliance
    risks with every payroll cycle.


    This guide gives you a complete technical blueprint for integrating Namely with
    Odoo 18. You will learn the exact architecture patterns, configuration steps,
    and data mapping strategies that eliminate manual work. We cover the real technical
    implementation from API authentication to error handling, providing specific code
    examples for Odoo 18''s updated framework. This approach ensures your HR and operational
    data flows in perfect sync, automating processes from onboarding to payroll.


    Expect a substantial technical project that demands careful planning. The integration
    requires a solid understanding of both systems'' APIs and data models. We estimate
    two to three weeks for a full production deployment, depending on your team''s
    familiarity with Odoo''s development environment. The process involves configuring
    Odoo modules, establishing secure API connections, and building robust data transformation
    logic.


    Your reward for this investment is a seamless operational engine. You will automate
    employee provisioning, sync real-time payroll data, and maintain perfect compliance
    across systems. This guide provides the exact technical path to achieve that unified
    state. Let''s build a connection that makes your business run smoother.'
  main_content: '## Integration Architecture and Data Flow


    ### Core Integration Patterns


    You have two primary architecture options for connecting Namely with Odoo 18.
    The first pattern uses Odoo as the integration hub. This approach leverages Odoo''s
    built-in webhook handlers and scheduled actions to manage data exchange. The second
    pattern employs a middleware layer, ideal for complex multi-system environments
    where you need additional transformation logic or must connect other applications
    beyond these two systems.


    Odoo-as-hub architecture simplifies your technical stack. You configure custom
    modules within Odoo that handle API calls to Namely''s REST endpoints. This pattern
    uses Odoo''s scheduled actions (ir.cron) to poll for changes and webhook endpoints
    to receive real-time updates from Namely. The middleware approach introduces a
    separate service, like a Python application on AWS Lambda, that orchestrates data
    flow between both systems.


    ### Data Flow Specifications


    Employee data synchronization follows a master-slave pattern. Namely typically
    serves as the system of record for HR information. Your integration pushes new
    hire data from Namely to Odoo, creating employee records, departments, and job
    positions. This flow ensures Odoo always reflects the current organizational structure
    for operational planning and financial reporting.


    Time and attendance data flows in the opposite direction. Odoo captures timesheets,
    project allocations, and leave requests from employees. Your integration packages
    this data and transmits it to Namely for payroll processing. This bidirectional
    flow creates a closed-loop system where HR records inform operations and operational
    data feeds payroll.


    ### Webhook Configuration Strategy


    Namely''s webhooks provide real-time notifications for key HR events. You configure
    these webhooks to point to custom endpoints in your Odoo installation. When an
    employee receives a promotion in Namely, the webhook fires immediately, triggering
    an update to that employee''s job title and salary information in Odoo. This real-time
    sync prevents data drift between systems.


    Your Odoo modules handle these webhook payloads. They parse the incoming JSON,
    validate the data structure, and apply business rules before updating Odoo records.
    This process maintains data integrity while ensuring operational systems reflect
    HR changes within minutes rather than days.


    ## Step-by-Step Configuration


    ### Namely API Authentication Setup


    Start with Namely''s API configuration. Log into your Namely company instance
    and navigate to the Developer Settings. Generate a new OAuth 2.0 client application
    specifically for Odoo integration. Note your Client ID and Client Secret – you
    will need these for the Odoo configuration. Configure the redirect URI to point
    to your Odoo instance''s authentication callback endpoint.


    Namely uses the authorization code grant flow. Your Odoo module must implement
    the OAuth2 handshake. Create a new Odoo configuration model that stores the authentication
    tokens. This model should encrypt the refresh token in the database and handle
    automatic token renewal before expiration. Implement proper error handling for
    authentication failures with clear logging for troubleshooting.


    ### Odoo Custom Module Development


    Create a new Odoo module named `hr_namely_sync`. Define your module manifest with
    the necessary dependencies: `hr`, `project`, and `website` for webhook handling.
    Create models for storing configuration, mapping tables, and sync logs. These
    models track the integration status and provide audit trails for data changes.


    Implement the core integration logic in a dedicated Python class. This class handles
    all API communication with Namely. It manages authentication, request retries,
    and error handling. Structure your code with separate methods for each data entity:
    employees, departments, jobs, and time entries. This modular approach simplifies
    maintenance and testing.


    ### Webhook Endpoint Implementation


    Build custom controllers in your Odoo module to receive Namely webhooks. Use Odoo''s
    CSRF exemption for these endpoints since they receive external POST requests.
    Implement signature verification to ensure webhook requests originate from Namely.
    Validate the payload structure before processing to prevent errors from malformed
    data.


    Create a job queue system using Odoo''s queue_job module. When a webhook arrives,
    your controller should validate the request and then enqueue a job for background
    processing. This design prevents timeouts and ensures your integration remains
    responsive during high-volume sync periods. The queued job handles the actual
    data processing and updates.


    ### Scheduled Action Configuration


    Configure Odoo''s scheduled actions for bidirectional sync. Set up a frequent
    job (every 15 minutes) to push timesheet data from Odoo to Namely. Create a daily
    job that performs a full employee data comparison to catch any discrepancies.
    These scheduled jobs provide a safety net for webhook failures and ensure data
    consistency.


    Implement incremental sync logic in your scheduled jobs. Use timestamp-based filtering
    to only process records modified since the last successful sync. This approach
    reduces API load and improves performance. Store the last sync timestamp for each
    data type in your configuration model, updating it after each successful synchronization
    cycle.


    ### Field Mapping Configuration Interface


    Build a user interface for field mapping configuration. Create an Odoo form view
    that displays Namely fields alongside their corresponding Odoo fields. Use selection
    widgets for field type matching and validation. Store these mappings in a dedicated
    model that your sync logic references during data transformation.


    Implement mapping validation rules. Check that required fields have mappings before
    allowing sync operations. Validate data type compatibility between source and
    target fields. Provide clear error messages when mappings contain inconsistencies.
    This validation prevents data corruption during synchronization.


    ### Testing Configuration Steps


    Verify your configuration with a systematic testing approach. Create test cases
    for each integration scenario: new employee creation, department transfer, and
    timesheet submission. Use Odoo''s test framework to automate these validations.
    Check that webhooks trigger the correct actions and that scheduled jobs complete
    without errors.


    Document the configuration sequence for deployment. Provide clear instructions
    for setting up Namely API credentials, installing the custom module, and configuring
    field mappings. Include troubleshooting tips for common installation issues like
    permission errors or missing dependencies.


    ## Data Mapping and Transformation


    ### Employee Data Model Alignment


    Namely''s employee API returns comprehensive JSON payloads with nested structures.
    Your transformation logic must flatten these structures into Odoo''s relational
    model. Map Namely''s `employee.first_name` and `employee.last_name` to Odoo''s
    `hr.employee.name` field. Handle middle names and suffixes according to your business
    rules – either concatenate them or store them in a separate field.


    Department and job title mapping requires special attention. Namely departments
    become Odoo''s `hr.department` records. Create a mapping table that correlates
    Namely department IDs to Odoo department records. Implement logic that creates
    new departments in Odoo when they appear in Namely data but lack existing mappings.
    This approach maintains organizational structure integrity.


    ### Compensation and Role Transformation


    Salary data transformation demands careful handling. Namely stores compensation
    in annual figures, while Odoo typically uses monthly values. Your transformation
    logic must convert these amounts based on pay period settings. Implement currency
    conversion if your Namely instance uses different currencies than your Odoo installation.
    Always log conversion actions for audit purposes.


    Job level and position mapping establishes your organizational hierarchy. Map
    Namely''s job titles to Odoo''s `hr.job` model. Create a consistent approach for
    handling similar roles across departments. Consider using a combination of department
    and job title to create unique position identifiers in Odoo. This prevents role
    confusion in multi-department organizations.


    ### Time and Attendance Data Flow


    Timesheet data moves from Odoo to Namely for payroll processing. Transform Odoo''s
    project-based time entries into Namely''s timesheet format. Map Odoo''s project
    and task information to Namely''s cost centers and work types. This mapping ensures
    proper allocation of labor costs in your financial systems.


    Leave request synchronization requires date format transformation. Odoo stores
    leave dates as Django datetime objects, while Namely uses ISO 8601 strings. Your
    transformation logic must convert these formats and handle timezone differences.
    Implement logic that accounts for partial-day leaves, converting Odoo''s hour-based
    records into Namely''s day-based format.


    ### Custom Field Handling Strategy


    Both systems support custom fields, but their data types may differ. Create a
    configuration interface that maps custom fields between systems. Implement type
    conversion rules for common mismatches – for example, converting Namely''s string-based
    custom fields to Odoo''s selection fields when value patterns match predefined
    options.


    Handle null values and default assignments consistently. Define transformation
    rules for empty fields in either system. Decide whether to use system defaults,
    leave values unchanged, or apply business logic to derive missing values. Document
    these decisions to maintain consistency during integration upgrades.


    ### Data Validation and Cleansing


    Implement preprocessing validation for all data transfers. Check required field
    completeness before attempting synchronization. Validate data formats like email
    addresses and phone numbers. Flag records that fail validation for manual review
    rather than allowing partial updates that could corrupt your data.


    Create data reconciliation reports that highlight synchronization discrepancies.
    Compare record counts between systems after each major sync. Identify records
    that exist in one system but not the other. These reports help you catch integration
    issues before they affect business operations.


    ## Error Handling and Resilience


    ### Common API Error Patterns


    Namely''s API returns standard HTTP status codes with specific error messages.
    Handle 429 rate limit errors with exponential backoff retry logic. Implement circuit
    breaker patterns that temporarily halt requests to Namely when error rates exceed
    thresholds. This prevents cascading failures during Namely service interruptions.


    Odoo database constraints cause common integration failures. Unique constraint
    violations occur when your integration attempts to create duplicate records. Foreign
    key errors happen when related records (like departments) don''t exist. Implement
    pre-insert validation that checks for these conditions and resolves them before
    attempting the database operation.


    ### Data Validation Error Recovery


    Field validation errors stem from data type mismatches. When Odoo rejects a value
    due to format constraints, your error handler should log the specific field and
    value that caused the failure. Implement transformation functions that convert
    problematic values to acceptable formats – for example, truncating overlength
    text fields or rounding decimal values.


    Handle partial success scenarios in batch operations. When syncing multiple records,
    some may succeed while others fail. Implement transaction logic that tracks successful
    operations and only retries the failures. Create rollback procedures for cases
    where partial success would create data inconsistency.


    ### Connection Failure Strategies


    Network timeouts require robust retry mechanisms. Configure your HTTP client with
    appropriate timeout values and retry limits. Implement a dead letter queue for
    records that fail after multiple retry attempts. This queue holds problematic
    records for manual investigation while allowing the integration to continue processing
    new data.


    Database connection pools in Odoo can exhaust during high-volume sync operations.
    Monitor connection usage and implement connection recycling in your integration
    code. Use Odoo''s queue_job system to distribute load across multiple workers.
    This horizontal scaling approach prevents database bottlenecks.


    ### Error Notification and Alerting


    Configure proactive monitoring for integration health. Set up alerts that trigger
    when error rates exceed defined thresholds. Use Odoo''s logging system to capture
    detailed error context, including stack traces and request payloads. Create dashboard
    views that display sync status and recent errors for quick troubleshooting.


    Implement escalation procedures for different error types. Critical errors like
    authentication failures should trigger immediate notifications to administrators.
    Data validation errors might only require daily summary reports. This tiered approach
    ensures appropriate response without alert fatigue.


    ### Recovery and Repair Procedures


    Build data repair tools for common synchronization issues. Create manual sync
    triggers that allow administrators to resync specific records or date ranges.
    Implement data comparison reports that highlight discrepancies between systems.
    These tools reduce recovery time when errors occur.


    Document standard operating procedures for integration failures. Provide clear
    steps for investigating common error patterns. Include scripts for resetting sync
    timestamps and clearing stuck queue jobs. This documentation ensures consistent
    response when troubleshooting production issues.


    ## Testing and Validation


    ### Integration Test Scenario Development


    Create comprehensive test cases that cover all integration scenarios. Test new
    employee onboarding from Namely to Odoo, verifying that all required fields populate
    correctly. Test department transfers to ensure reporting structure updates propagate
    properly. Test termination workflows to confirm access revocation in both systems.


    Develop negative test cases that simulate failure conditions. Test how your integration
    handles malformed webhook payloads from Namely. Verify error recovery when Odoo''s
    database becomes temporarily unavailable. These tests ensure your integration
    remains stable under adverse conditions.


    ### Data Validation Test Procedures


    Implement data consistency checks that run after each sync operation. Compare
    record counts for key entities between systems. Sample check specific field values
    to ensure data transformation applied correctly. Create automated validation scripts
    that flag discrepancies for investigation.


    Test edge cases and boundary conditions. Verify how your integration handles employees
    with unusual characters in their names. Test date formatting around timezone transitions
    and daylight saving time changes. These edge case tests prevent surprises when
    unusual data enters your systems.


    ### Performance Benchmark Testing


    Establish performance baselines for sync operations. Measure how long complete
    employee sync takes with different data volumes. Test webhook response times under
    concurrent load. Set performance thresholds that trigger alerts when sync operations
    exceed expected timeframes.


    Load test your integration with production-like data volumes. Generate test datasets
    that mirror your actual employee count and transaction frequency. Monitor system
    resources during these tests to identify potential bottlenecks. Use these results
    to right-size your infrastructure.


    ### User Acceptance Testing Framework


    Create business-focused test scenarios that mirror real operational workflows.
    Have HR administrators execute common processes like hiring and promotion while
    verifying the integration works as expected. Involve finance team members in testing
    timesheet and payroll data accuracy.


    Document testing procedures and success criteria. Provide checklists that testers
    can use to validate each integration feature. Capture feedback from business users
    about data quality and process improvements. This user validation ensures the
    integration meets actual business needs.


    ### Production Validation Checklist


    Implement go-live validation procedures. Verify all field mappings work correctly
    with production data. Confirm webhook endpoints receive and process notifications
    from Namely. Test the full sync cycle in a production environment before enabling
    automated scheduling.


    Create ongoing monitoring checks that validate integration health. Set up daily
    reconciliation reports that compare key metrics between systems. Implement alerting
    for data freshness – if no sync occurs within expected timeframes, trigger investigations.
    These continuous validation practices maintain long-term reliability.


    ## Security Considerations


    ### API Authentication Security


    Implement secure credential management for Namely API access. Store OAuth2 tokens
    encrypted in Odoo''s database using its built-in encryption fields. Never log
    authentication credentials or include them in error messages. Implement token
    rotation procedures that refresh access tokens before expiration.


    Secure your webhook endpoints against unauthorized access. Validate Namely''s
    webhook signatures to ensure requests originate from legitimate sources. Implement
    rate limiting on webhook endpoints to prevent denial-of-service attacks. Use HTTPS
    with strong cipher suites for all external communication.


    ### Data Protection and Privacy


    Apply principle of least privilege to data access. Configure your integration
    to only request necessary scopes from Namely''s API. Implement field-level filtering
    that excludes sensitive personal data not required for Odoo operations. Create
    data retention policies that purge sync logs after defined periods.


    Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest. Use TLS 1.2 or higher for all API
    communications between systems. Ensure your Odoo database encryption protects
    personally identifiable information. Implement access controls that restrict integration
    data to authorized personnel only.


    ### Compliance and Audit Requirements


    Maintain detailed audit trails for all data modifications. Log every sync operation
    with timestamps, user context, and change details. Implement data lineage tracking
    that shows the origin and transformation history for each record. These audit
    logs support compliance with regulations like GDPR and CCPA.


    Conduct regular security assessments of your integration. Perform penetration
    testing on webhook endpoints and API connectors. Review access logs for suspicious
    patterns. Update integration components to address security vulnerabilities in
    dependent libraries.


    ### Access Control Implementation


    Implement role-based access to integration configuration. Restrict Namely API
    credential management to authorized administrators. Create separate permission
    sets for integration monitoring versus configuration changes. This separation
    of duties prevents unauthorized modification of sync behavior.


    Secure integration infrastructure components. Harden the servers hosting your
    Odoo instance with security updates and intrusion detection. Implement network
    segmentation that limits access to integration endpoints. Use web application
    firewalls to protect against common attack vectors.


    ## Performance Optimization


    ### API Call Efficiency Strategies


    Minimize API calls to Namely through intelligent batching. Instead of fetching
    individual employee records, use Namely''s bulk endpoints to retrieve multiple
    records in single requests. Implement client-side caching that stores frequently
    accessed data like department lists and job codes.


    Optimize payload sizes by requesting only necessary fields. Use field filtering
    parameters in Namely API calls to exclude unused data. Implement compression for
    large payloads, especially when syncing historical timecard data. These reductions
    decrease transfer times and reduce API rate limit consumption.


    ### Database Optimization Techniques


    Optimize Odoo database queries in your integration code. Use PostgreSQL indexes
    on frequently queried fields like employee external IDs and sync timestamps. Implement
    database connection pooling to reduce connection overhead. Monitor query performance
    and add missing indexes as your data volume grows.


    Batch database write operations to reduce transaction overhead. Instead of updating
    records individually, collect multiple changes and apply them in bulk transactions.
    This approach reduces database lock contention and improves overall throughput
    during large sync operations.


    ### Memory and Resource Management


    Implement efficient memory usage in data transformation logic. Process large datasets
    in chunks rather than loading everything into memory at once. Use generator expressions
    and streaming processing for large data exports. Monitor memory usage during sync
    operations and optimize data structures that consume excessive resources.


    Manage background job resources effectively. Configure Odoo''s queue_job workers
    with appropriate resource limits. Implement job priority levels that ensure critical
    sync operations receive necessary resources. Monitor worker performance and scale
    horizontally when job backlogs develop.


    ### Monitoring and Capacity Planning


    Implement comprehensive performance monitoring. Track sync duration, API response
    times, and database performance metrics. Set up alerts that trigger when performance
    degrades beyond acceptable thresholds. Use these metrics for capacity planning
    as your data volumes increase over time.


    Create performance dashboards that visualize integration health. Display real-time
    sync status, error rates, and throughput metrics. Implement trend analysis that
    predicts when you need infrastructure upgrades. These insights help you maintain
    optimal performance as business needs evolve.'
