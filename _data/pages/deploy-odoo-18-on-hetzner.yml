  introduction: 'Deploy Odoo 18 on Hetzner Cloud: Complete 2025 Guide requires specific
    technical decisions at every layer—operating system selection, PostgreSQL version
    and configuration, Python environment setup, NGINX reverse proxy implementation,
    SSL certificate management, and systemd service orchestration. This guide makes
    those decisions explicit, explaining the reasoning behind each configuration choice
    and the production implications of alternatives you might encounter.


    Odoo deployments fail most often from accumulated small configuration errors rather
    than single catastrophic mistakes. Installing PostgreSQL without tuning shared_buffers
    creates memory pressure. Configuring NGINX without extended timeouts causes request
    failures. Running Odoo without proper systemd management means manual restarts
    after updates. Each individual mistake seems minor until they compound into production
    instability.'
  deployment_guide: 'Start by understanding Hetzner''s CPX-series pricing structure
    because it directly impacts your five-year total cost of ownership. The CPX21
    delivers three dedicated AMD vCPUs and four gigabytes of RAM for ten dollars and
    fifty-nine cents monthly, suitable for fifteen to forty users running standard
    Odoo modules without heavy customization. The CPX31 doubles the RAM to eight gigabytes,
    adds a fourth dedicated vCPU, and includes one hundred sixty gigabytes of local
    NVMe storage for eighteen dollars and fifty-nine cents. Most businesses implementing
    Odoo should select the CPX31. The additional eight dollars monthly buys meaningful
    headroom for PostgreSQL query caching, background workers, and the inevitable
    module additions that occur six months after go-live.


    The datacenter selection carries implications beyond latency. Hetzner''s European
    datacenters in Falkenstein, Nuremberg, and Helsinki include twenty terabytes of
    monthly traffic at no additional cost, reflecting the company''s German roots
    and EU-centric infrastructure investments. The Ashburn, Virginia datacenter includes
    only one terabyte, with overage charges applying beyond that threshold. For businesses
    serving primarily European customers or those requiring GDPR-compliant data residency,
    the EU datacenter choice is obvious.


    Create your Hetzner Cloud account and immediately configure SSH key authentication.
    Generate an ed25519 SSH key pair on your local workstation, upload the public
    key to the Hetzner Cloud Console under Security. Launch a CPX31 instance selecting
    Ubuntu 24.04 LTS. Hetzner''s cloud-init integration means your server will be
    accessible via SSH within sixty seconds.


    Configure the firewall before installing any services using both Hetzner''s cloud-level
    firewall and UFW. Install PostgreSQL 16 from the official repository, create a
    dedicated odoo user, and tune configuration for 8GB RAM. Install Odoo 18 from
    source to /opt/odoo, create a systemd service, and configure workers using the
    formula workers equals CPU count times two plus one, resulting in nine workers
    for four cores.


    Install NGINX as reverse proxy, configure SSL termination with Let''s Encrypt
    via Certbot. Implement automated PostgreSQL backups using pg_dump with daily retention
    and upload to off-site storage. The total production cost runs approximately thirty-four
    dollars monthly: eighteen dollars fifty-nine cents for CPX31, five dollars for
    backup storage, and minimal costs for snapshots.

    '
  conclusion: 'You achieved practical digital sovereignty by deploying Deploy Odoo
    18 on Hetzner Cloud: Complete 2025 Guide on infrastructure you control at $50-100
    monthly. This system eliminates dependency on managed Odoo hosting providers who
    lock you into proprietary platforms, restrict customization freedom, and increase
    prices arbitrarily because they control your data and operational access. You
    own your Odoo instance, your PostgreSQL database, your backup strategy, and your
    ability to migrate to different infrastructure providers if business requirements
    or pricing changes.


    The sovereignty advantage compounds over time. Your Odoo data exports to standard
    PostgreSQL dump files that restore on any compatible infrastructure—Hetzner Cloud,
    competing cloud providers, or on-premises hardware. Your configuration exists
    in documented scripts and files you can version control and replicate. Your operational
    knowledge transfers across infrastructure platforms because you understand the
    underlying components rather than provider-specific management interfaces. This
    portability and knowledge ownership protect against vendor lock-in and preserve
    your ability to optimize costs as your business evolves.


    Maintain this sovereignty by documenting your deployment, testing your backups
    quarterly, and staying current with security updates. The infrastructure you built
    today serves business needs for years while remaining under your control—that
    combination of longevity, ownership, and cost efficiency justifies the deployment
    effort and establishes the operational foundation your business deserves.



    Before declaring your deployment complete, run the [backup readiness checker](/toolkit/odoo-backup-readiness-checker/).
    This 60-second assessment validates encryption, tests restoration procedures,
    and confirms off-site storage configuration.'
