ai_generated_content:
  introduction: 'Hetzner Cloud''s CPX31 (Dedicated AMD) instance delivers the compute
    and memory resources that Odoo 18 requires for production deployments serving
    Medium Business (30-80 users). The 4 dedicated vCPUs handle concurrent user requests
    without CPU steal, while 8GB RAM provides sufficient headroom for PostgreSQL query
    caching.


    Odoo deployments fail most often from accumulated small configuration errors rather
    than single catastrophic mistakes. Installing PostgreSQL without tuning shared_buffers
    creates memory pressure. Configuring NGINX without extended timeouts causes request
    failures. Running Odoo without proper systemd management means manual restarts
    after updates. Each individual mistake seems minor until they compound into production
    instability.'
  conclusion: 'Your Deploy Odoo 18 on Hetzner Cloud: Complete 2025 Guide deployment
    on Hetzner Cloud is production-ready. The system includes automated daily backups
    with off-site storage, SSL certificates with automatic renewal, firewall rules
    that balance security with access requirements, and PostgreSQL tuning optimized
    for 8GB RAM. You can begin migrating data, configuring Odoo modules, and onboarding
    users immediately without additional infrastructure preparation.


    The deployment process you followed represents years of accumulated production
    experience distilled into ninety minutes of focused implementation. The specific
    NGINX timeout settings prevent module installation failures. The PostgreSQL shared_buffers
    calculation matches your instance RAM profile. The systemd service configuration
    ensures Odoo restarts automatically after system updates. These aren''t theoretical
    best practices—they''re battle-tested configurations that prevent the operational
    problems that plague under-prepared Odoo deployments.


    Next actions focus on application layer setup rather than infrastructure concerns.
    Install your required Odoo modules, import your data using the migration scripts
    provided in the Fortress Protection module, configure user accounts and permissions,
    and establish your backup validation routine. The infrastructure foundation you
    built today won''t require revisiting until you outgrow Medium Business (30-80
    users)—and when that growth happens, you have the operational knowledge to scale
    confidently.

    configurations.'
  troubleshooting_guide: '## Common Issues and Solutions


    **Issue: Odoo service fails to start after installation**


    Check the service status and logs to identify the specific error. Run `systemctl
    status odoo` to see if systemd reports configuration file errors, permission problems,
    or missing dependencies. Most startup failures trace to incorrect paths in the
    configuration file—verify `/etc/odoo/odoo.conf` contains valid paths to the Odoo
    installation directory, addons folders, and log file location. Cloud-specific
    issues often involve security group or firewall rules blocking access. Verify
    your cloud provider''s security groups allow port 8069 inbound traffic. Check
    the instance''s system logs through the cloud console for out-of-memory errors
    or disk space issues. Cloud instances with insufficient RAM (less than 4GB) cannot
    run Odoo reliably—workers crash under load, requiring instance resize.


    **Issue: Database connection errors**


    Odoo cannot connect to PostgreSQL, typically showing "FATAL: password authentication
    failed" or "could not connect to server" errors. Verify PostgreSQL is running
    with `systemctl status postgresql`, confirm the Odoo database user exists with
    correct credentials, and check `pg_hba.conf` allows local connections. The Odoo
    configuration file''s `db_user`, `db_password`, and `db_host` parameters must
    match your PostgreSQL setup exactly—case sensitivity matters for usernames.


    **Issue: Port 8069 not accessible from browser**


    The firewall blocks incoming connections to Odoo''s default port. Cloud providers
    use both network-level security groups and OS-level firewalls. Configure security
    group rules in your cloud console to allow port 8069 from 0.0.0.0/0 (or restrict
    to specific IP ranges). Then configure the OS firewall as described above. Both
    layers must permit traffic for connections to succeed. For production deployments
    behind NGINX reverse proxy, you should block external port 8069 access entirely
    and only expose ports 80/443, which NGINX proxies to Odoo''s localhost:8069.


    **Issue: Module installation fails with dependency errors**


    Odoo modules declare dependencies on other modules, and installation fails if
    dependencies are missing or if circular dependencies exist. Read the error message
    carefully—it specifies which module dependency is missing. Install missing modules
    through the Apps menu first, then retry the original module installation. For
    custom modules, verify the `__manifest__.py` file declares all dependencies in
    the `depends` list.


    **Issue: PDF generation produces blank or malformed documents**


    Cloud instances often use minimal OS images without X11 libraries. Install complete
    wkhtmltopdf dependencies: `apt install -y libxrender1 libfontconfig1 libxext6`
    (Ubuntu) or equivalent for your distribution. Verify fonts are available for PDF
    rendering: `fc-list` should show multiple font families. Missing fonts cause PDFs
    with blank characters or incorrect layout.


    **Issue: Performance degradation with increasing users**


    Cloud instance sizing matters more than on-premises servers. Burstable instances
    (AWS t-series, Azure B-series) accumulate CPU credits during idle periods but
    throttle under sustained load. Monitor CPU credit balance in your cloud console.
    If credits deplete regularly, upgrade to a general-purpose instance type. Enable
    detailed monitoring to identify whether CPU, memory, or disk I/O is the bottleneck.


    **Issue: Backup or restore operations fail**


    Cloud storage integration requires proper IAM permissions and network connectivity.
    Verify the instance can reach S3/Azure Blob/GCS endpoints with `curl` or `wget`.
    Check IAM role attached to the instance has write permissions to your backup bucket.
    For cross-region backups, ensure your bucket policy allows writes from the instance''s
    region. Test backup scripts manually before scheduling automated runs.


    **Issue: SSL certificate errors or mixed content warnings**


    Cloud load balancers can terminate SSL, making NGINX configuration different.
    If using a load balancer for SSL, configure it to forward `X-Forwarded-Proto`
    headers, and set NGINX to trust these headers with `proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto
    $scheme`. Verify the load balancer''s health checks target the correct port and
    path—failed health checks prevent traffic routing.

  deployment_guide: 'The first decision determines your cost structure for the next
    year: which instance type matches your workload without overprovisioning. The
    t3.medium offers 2 vCPUs and 4GB RAM at $30.37 monthly on-demand, suitable for
    businesses with 10-30 users running standard Odoo modules like Sales, CRM, and
    Inventory. If your team exceeds 30 users or you''re deploying manufacturing or
    accounting modules with complex calculations, the m6i.large provides 8GB RAM at
    $89.28 monthly, which prevents the memory-swap thrashing that kills Odoo responsiveness
    under load. The wildcard option is the t4g.medium, an ARM-based Graviton instance
    at $24.30 monthly that delivers identical specs to the t3.medium but costs 20%
    less.


    Launch your chosen instance through the cloud provider''s console with Ubuntu
    24.04 LTS as the base image. AWS provides official Ubuntu AMIs updated monthly,
    eliminating the malware-laden AMI risk that plagues community images. During launch
    configuration, create a new key pair for SSH access and download the private key
    immediately—AWS doesn''t store it, and you''ll need it for every future access.


    Security group configuration requires precision, not paranoia. Create a new security
    group with four inbound rules: SSH (port 22) restricted to your office IP address
    or VPN endpoint, HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) open to 0.0.0.0/0 for public
    access, and port 8069 open to 0.0.0.0/0 temporarily during initial setup. After
    SSL works, delete the 8069 rule entirely. Many guides leave it open permanently,
    creating an unencrypted access vector that bypasses your HTTPS enforcement.


    Connect via SSH and begin the installation phase. You face a fundamental architecture
    choice: Docker Compose or native installation. Docker Compose offers faster initial
    deployment and easier version upgrades—you change one line in a docker-compose.yml
    file and restart containers. Native installation gives you deeper control over
    Python dependencies and system-level optimizations, plus it avoids the 10-15%
    performance overhead Docker networking layers introduce. For most the cloud provider
    deployments, native installation makes sense because you''re already managing
    infrastructure—you''ve chosen the cloud provider over managed hosting precisely
    to maximize control.


    Install PostgreSQL 16 locally first with apt, then add the Odoo 18 repository,
    install the odoo package, and configure it to bind to localhost only while you
    test functionality.


    The PostgreSQL decision carries operational weight. Self-hosting PostgreSQL on
    the same instance simplifies the architecture and eliminates additional database
    costs, but puts database administration on your team. You''ll handle vacuum operations,
    index optimization, and backup verification yourself. RDS managed PostgreSQL removes
    those responsibilities and adds automated backups with point-in-time recovery,
    but introduces 2-4ms network latency between Odoo and the database that impacts
    report generation and bulk import operations. If your team lacks a database specialist
    and your Odoo instance handles under 100 concurrent users, RDS is the pragmatic
    choice. Launch a db.t3.micro with 20GB storage and enable automated backups with
    a 7-day retention window.


    SSL termination through Let''s Encrypt provides free certificates with automated
    renewal, but requires a reverse proxy. Install Nginx, create a server block that
    proxies requests from port 443 to Odoo''s port 8069, and run Certbot to obtain
    certificates for your domain. The critical configuration detail most guides omit:
    set proxy_read_timeout to 600 seconds in your Nginx server block. Odoo''s module
    installation and large report generation operations can take several minutes,
    and Nginx''s default 60-second timeout kills these requests prematurely, generating
    cryptic "bad gateway" errors.


    AWS-specific optimizations start with EBS volume tuning. Enable EBS optimization
    on your EC2 instance through the console, which dedicates network bandwidth to
    storage traffic and prevents disk I/O from competing with Odoo''s HTTP traffic.
    Attach an IAM role to the instance with CloudWatch agent permissions, install
    the CloudWatch agent, and configure it to stream Odoo''s log files to CloudWatch
    Logs.


    The Reserved Instance decision happens after you validate the deployment. Run
    on-demand pricing for the first month while you confirm the instance size handles
    your actual workload and user count. Once you''ve settled on the right size, purchase
    a one-year reserved instance through the EC2 console—you''ll pay the full year
    upfront or choose monthly payments at a slight premium. The 36% savings compounds
    monthly, totaling $133 annually for a t3.medium reservation.


    The total monthly the cloud provider cost for a production Odoo 18 deployment
    runs approximately $30-50. This includes compute, storage, and data transfer costs.
