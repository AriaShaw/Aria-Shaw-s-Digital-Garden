  introduction: 'Hetzner Cloud''s CPX31 (Dedicated AMD) instance delivers the compute
    and memory resources that {{ odoo_version.name }} requires for production deployments
    serving Medium Business (30-80 users). The 4 dedicated vCPUs handle concurrent
    user requests without CPU steal, while 8GB RAM provides sufficient headroom for
    PostgreSQL query caching.


    Managed Odoo providers restrict customization, charge premium rates for additional
    storage or compute resources, and create vendor lock-in through proprietary backup
    formats and limited data export options. When you deploy on infrastructure you
    control, you eliminate these restrictions while gaining operational knowledge
    that survives vendor changes and protects against arbitrary price increases.'
  deployment_guide: 'Start by understanding Hetzner''s CPX-series pricing structure
    because it directly impacts your five-year total cost of ownership. The CPX21
    delivers three dedicated AMD vCPUs and four gigabytes of RAM for ten dollars and
    fifty-nine cents monthly, suitable for fifteen to forty users running standard
    Odoo modules without heavy customization. The CPX31 doubles the RAM to eight gigabytes,
    adds a fourth dedicated vCPU, and includes one hundred sixty gigabytes of local
    NVMe storage for eighteen dollars and fifty-nine cents. Most businesses implementing
    Odoo should select the CPX31. The additional eight dollars monthly buys meaningful
    headroom for PostgreSQL query caching, background workers, and the inevitable
    module additions that occur six months after go-live.


    The datacenter selection carries implications beyond latency. Hetzner''s European
    datacenters in Falkenstein, Nuremberg, and Helsinki include twenty terabytes of
    monthly traffic at no additional cost, reflecting the company''s German roots
    and EU-centric infrastructure investments. The Ashburn, Virginia datacenter includes
    only one terabyte, with overage charges applying beyond that threshold. For businesses
    serving primarily European customers or those requiring GDPR-compliant data residency,
    the EU datacenter choice is obvious.


    Create your Hetzner Cloud account and immediately configure SSH key authentication.
    Generate an ed25519 SSH key pair on your local workstation, upload the public
    key to the Hetzner Cloud Console under Security. Launch a CPX31 instance selecting
    Ubuntu 24.04 LTS. Hetzner''s cloud-init integration means your server will be
    accessible via SSH within sixty seconds.


    Configure the firewall before installing any services using both Hetzner''s cloud-level
    firewall and UFW. Install PostgreSQL 16 from the official repository, create a
    dedicated odoo user, and tune configuration for 8GB RAM. Install Odoo 18 from
    source to /opt/odoo, create a systemd service, and configure workers using the
    formula workers equals CPU count times two plus one, resulting in nine workers
    for four cores.


    Install NGINX as reverse proxy, configure SSL termination with Let''s Encrypt
    via Certbot. Implement automated PostgreSQL backups using pg_dump with daily retention
    and upload to off-site storage. The total production cost runs approximately thirty-four
    dollars monthly: eighteen dollars fifty-nine cents for CPX31, five dollars for
    backup storage, and minimal costs for snapshots.

    '
  conclusion: 'The Deploy Odoo 18 on Hetzner Cloud: Complete 2025 Guide system you
    deployed demonstrates that production-grade Odoo infrastructure doesn''t require
    managed service providers or enterprise support contracts. You configured every
    component yourself—from Hetzner Cloud firewall rules through PostgreSQL parameter
    tuning to Let''s Encrypt SSL automation—and gained operational knowledge that
    survives vendor changes, price increases, and service discontinuations.


    This hands-on deployment approach delivers advantages that extend beyond immediate
    cost savings. You understand exactly how Odoo connects to PostgreSQL, how NGINX
    handles SSL termination and request proxying, where log files accumulate, and
    which processes consume memory under load. That knowledge eliminates the helpless
    dependency on support tickets and vendor response times that paralyzes businesses
    when production issues emerge during month-end financial closes or customer deadline
    pressure.


    Your infrastructure now supports the next growth phase. The CPX31 (Dedicated AMD)
    instance with 8GB RAM handles Medium Business (30-80 users), and you know exactly
    how to upgrade to larger instance types when user counts exceed current capacity.
    The automated backup system protects against data loss. The monitoring foundation
    provides visibility into system health. You built infrastructure that serves business
    needs for years, not months—that durability and control define digital sovereignty.

    headline: Automate Your Backup Strategy
    body: 'The deployment you just completed needs backup protection before you migrate
      production data. Manual backup procedures fail when administrators forget to
      run them during critical periods or when month-end workload pressure pushes
      routine maintenance to "tomorrow."


      Start with our **free Enhanced Backup Script** that handles daily PostgreSQL
      backups with compression and rotation policies. The script runs unattended via
      cron, eliminating manual backup failures that cost businesses thousands in lost
      data.
