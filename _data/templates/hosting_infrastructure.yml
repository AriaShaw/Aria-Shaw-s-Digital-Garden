  # Decision Framework: Help users understand what matters for their situation
  decision_factors:
    - factor: "Business Size"
      importance: "critical"
      considerations:
        - "1-10 users: Shared hosting or small VPS sufficient"
        - "10-50 users: Dedicated VPS or small cloud instance"
        - "50-200 users: Multi-server or managed cloud"
        - "200+ users: High-availability architecture required"

    - factor: "Technical Expertise"
      importance: "high"
      considerations:
        - "No IT team: Managed hosting (Odoo.sh) or fully managed VPS"
        - "Basic Linux skills: Guided cloud deployment with monitoring"
        - "Experienced DevOps: Self-hosted with custom architecture"

    - factor: "Budget Constraints"
      importance: "high"
      considerations:
        - "Minimal budget: Self-hosted VPS ($10-50/month)"
        - "Moderate budget: Cloud providers ($50-300/month)"
        - "Enterprise budget: Managed Odoo.sh or hybrid ($500+/month)"

    - factor: "Data Sovereignty"
      importance: "medium-high"
      considerations:
        - "Regulatory compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA)"
        - "Geographic data residency mandates"
        - "Industry-specific security standards"

    - factor: "Scalability Needs"
      importance: "medium"
      considerations:
        - "Stable user count: Single server adequate"
        - "Seasonal fluctuations: Cloud auto-scaling valuable"
        - "Rapid growth expected: Start with scalable architecture"

  # Common Pitfalls & Mistakes
  common_mistakes:
    - mistake: "Choosing cheapest VPS without considering growth"
      consequence: "Expensive migration later or performance issues"
      solution: "Plan for 2x growth, choose provider with easy scaling"

    - mistake: "Underestimating DevOps time for self-hosted"
      consequence: "Hidden costs exceed managed hosting savings"
      solution: "Factor 10-20 hours/month DevOps time for self-hosted"

    - mistake: "Choosing on-premise without backup strategy"
      consequence: "Data loss risk, no disaster recovery"
      solution: "Budget for off-site backups and redundancy"

    - mistake: "Selecting Odoo.sh without checking module compatibility"
      consequence: "Custom modules won't work, expensive re-development"
      solution: "Audit custom modules before committing to Odoo.sh"
