      {{problem_type}} issues in Odoo installations manifest through symptoms users report—database locked errors during month-end processing, timeout failures when generating large reports, session expired messages that force repeated logins—but resolving these problems requires diagnosing root causes rather than applying symptomatic fixes that provide temporary relief until issues resurface. This troubleshooting guide implements systematic diagnostic procedures: analyzing PostgreSQL logs for deadlock patterns, reviewing Odoo worker process configuration for inadequate capacity, inspecting nginx timeout settings, and testing hypothetical fixes in staging environments before applying them to production systems users depend on.

      Production {{problem_type}} problems demand rapid resolution when business operations halt and users sit idle waiting for systems to recover. This troubleshooting guide prioritizes immediate restoration over perfect diagnosis: implementing known fixes for common failure patterns, rolling back recent changes that correlate with problem onset, and restarting services that accumulated resource exhaustion over time. The procedures documented here restore operations within minutes rather than hours, then guide proper root cause analysis that prevents recurrence rather than creating patterns where the same failures require repeated emergency intervention.

      Effective troubleshooting of {{problem_type}} issues requires understanding where Odoo logs diagnostic information and how to interpret messages that technical documentation rarely explains clearly. PostgreSQL logs record query execution times and deadlock details at /var/log/postgresql/, Odoo application logs capture Python exceptions and workflow errors in /var/log/odoo/, nginx logs show request patterns and timeout failures in /var/log/nginx/, and systemd logs track service lifecycle events through journalctl. This troubleshooting guide walks through systematic log analysis: identifying error patterns that indicate specific failure modes, correlating timestamps across different log sources to understand event sequences, and using log messages to narrow diagnostic focus from vague user complaints to specific configuration issues with documented solutions.

      Troubleshooting problems after users report failures represents reactive operational posture where business disruption precedes remediation. This troubleshooting guide implements proactive monitoring that detects degradation trends before they impact operations: PostgreSQL query performance monitoring that alerts when execution times increase twenty percent above baseline, disk space monitoring that triggers before filesystems fill completely, memory usage tracking that warns before worker processes start swapping, and connection pool monitoring that identifies resource exhaustion patterns. The operational discipline documented here transforms troubleshooting from emergency response into planned maintenance executed during low-usage windows.

      Organizations that don't document troubleshooting procedures rely on individual knowledge that walks out the door when key administrators leave, forcing new team members to rediscover solutions through trial and error that disrupts production operations. This troubleshooting guide implements runbook discipline: documenting diagnostic procedures that identify {{problem_type}} root causes, recording resolution steps with specific commands and configuration changes, noting validation tests that confirm fixes actually resolve problems, and maintaining post-incident reviews that capture lessons learned for future reference. The knowledge management approach documented here transforms troubleshooting from individual heroics into organizational capability that persists through staff turnover and scales as operations complexity grows.
