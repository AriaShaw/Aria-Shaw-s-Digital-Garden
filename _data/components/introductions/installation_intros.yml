      Installing Odoo {{odoo_version}} on {{os_name}} {{os_version}} from source code provides complete control over your ERP infrastructure—from database configuration through module selection to upgrade timing. Unlike managed hosting that abstracts infrastructure behind opaque control panels, source installation gives you direct access to configuration files, PostgreSQL tuning parameters, and system resources that determine whether your Odoo instance handles ten users or one hundred.

      When your business outgrows spreadsheets and needs proper ERP infrastructure, installing Odoo {{odoo_version}} on {{os_name}} gives you sovereignty over your business data. This guide walks through native installation—not Docker containers that abstract complexity, but direct system installation that you'll understand and control.

      The technical competency investment of installing Odoo {{odoo_version}} on {{os_name}} from source pays dividends throughout your ERP lifecycle. When performance issues emerge, you diagnose PostgreSQL query patterns rather than filing support tickets. When security updates release, you apply them on your schedule after testing in staging environments. When module conflicts break functionality, you inspect Python stack traces and patch code directly.

      Installing Odoo {{odoo_version}} on {{os_name}} {{os_version}} requires careful consideration of your architecture before executing installation commands. The single-server deployment documented here suits businesses with 10-50 concurrent users and handles typical ERP workloads—accounting, inventory management, CRM, sales orders—without performance degradation. If your team exceeds 50 users or processes high-volume transactions, you need separated application and database tiers from the start.

      Two paths exist for running Odoo {{odoo_version}}: managed SaaS hosting or self-hosted infrastructure on {{os_name}}. SaaS trades operational control for convenience. Self-hosting trades initial complexity for long-term sovereignty. This guide assumes you've chosen sovereignty—controlling your data, your upgrades, your infrastructure costs, and your vendor relationships.
