      Developing custom modules for Odoo {{odoo_version}} requires understanding the framework's MVC architecture, ORM query patterns, view inheritance mechanisms, and the JavaScript framework that renders the frontend. The development patterns documented here follow Odoo's technical guidelines to create modules that integrate cleanly with core functionality, survive version upgrades without extensive refactoring, and maintain the performance characteristics that separate professional implementations from hobby projects that collapse under production load.

      Generic Odoo modules handle eighty percent of business requirements—the remaining twenty percent requires custom development to implement your specific workflows, business rules, and integration requirements. This development guide walks through the module creation process from requirements analysis through testing and deployment, focusing on maintainable code that extends Odoo's core functionality rather than fighting against framework patterns that developers who don't understand Odoo's architecture tend to violate.

      Custom Odoo {{odoo_version}} modules that perform adequately during development testing with fifty records frequently collapse when production databases contain fifty thousand records and twenty concurrent users execute queries simultaneously. The development patterns in this guide prioritize production scalability from initial design—implementing efficient ORM queries that leverage PostgreSQL indexes, minimizing computed field calculations, using recordset operations that batch database access, and avoiding the N+1 query patterns that plague modules written by developers unfamiliar with Odoo's lazy evaluation semantics.

      Custom modules developed without consideration for Odoo's version upgrade patterns create technical debt that prevents businesses from adopting new Odoo {{odoo_version}} releases until expensive refactoring projects complete. This development guide implements upgrade-resilient patterns—avoiding undocumented API usage, implementing graceful handling of core model changes, using stable integration points that Odoo maintains across versions, and documenting customization decisions that help future developers understand intent rather than just implementation mechanics.

      Custom Odoo modules that bypass security group validation, implement inadequate input sanitization, or expose business logic through unprotected API endpoints create vulnerabilities that compromise entire Odoo installations. This development guide integrates security best practices throughout the module creation process—implementing proper record rules, validating user input at controller level, using Odoo's security groups correctly, preventing SQL injection through parameterized queries, and following the principle of least privilege that limits damage from potential security breaches or malicious insider actions.
