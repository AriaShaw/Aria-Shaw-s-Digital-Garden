      {{system_name}} performance degradation rarely announces itself through catastrophic failures—instead, reports that generated in five seconds now take thirty, inventory searches that returned instantly now timeout, and month-end closes that completed overnight now require manual intervention to finish. This performance optimization guide addresses the root causes underlying these symptoms: untuned PostgreSQL parameters that leave eighty percent of system RAM unused, missing database indexes that force sequential scans through million-row tables, and inefficient Odoo queries that developers implemented without understanding ORM performance implications.

      Odoo instances that perform adequately with twenty users frequently become unusable when concurrent user counts reach fifty—not because the platform can't scale, but because initial deployments used default configurations optimized for minimal resource usage rather than production workloads. This optimization guide implements tuning patterns that unlock your hardware's actual capacity, typically doubling concurrent user support without additional infrastructure investment through PostgreSQL memory allocation, worker process configuration, and query optimization that most Odoo installations never implement.

      Diagnosing {{system_name}} performance problems requires systematic analysis that distinguishes actual bottlenecks from symptoms users report. Slow report generation might indicate PostgreSQL configuration issues, inefficient query patterns, inadequate worker processes, or insufficient server memory—each requires different remediation approaches. This optimization guide implements methodical performance analysis: establishing baseline metrics for CPU utilization and memory consumption, profiling database query execution plans to identify table scans requiring indexes, analyzing Odoo log files for timeout patterns, and testing optimization changes in staging environments before applying them to production. The diagnostic process documented here prevents the cargo-cult tuning where administrators apply random configuration changes hoping for improvement but lacking verification that changes actually address root causes.

      Performance degradation in production Odoo systems occurs gradually through accumulated maintenance neglect—PostgreSQL tables that never vacuum deleted records, database indexes fragmented by constant updates, log files consuming disk space, and cached sessions accumulating in memory. This optimization guide implements preventive maintenance routines that preserve system performance through growth: automated vacuum schedules calibrated for transaction volume, index rebuild procedures, log rotation, and monitoring baselines that alert administrators to degradation trends before users report problems. The operational discipline documented here prevents the emergency performance remediation projects that disrupt business operations.

      Throwing additional CPU cores and RAM at Odoo performance problems provides diminishing returns when underlying configuration doesn't utilize existing resources efficiently. This optimization guide maximizes value from your current infrastructure through tuning that makes effective use of available hardware: PostgreSQL shared memory allocation that actually utilizes system RAM, worker process configuration matched to CPU count, connection pooling that prevents resource exhaustion, and filesystem optimizations for database storage. The patterns documented here typically deliver forty to sixty percent performance improvement on existing hardware—deferring expensive infrastructure upgrades while you scale operations and determine if growth trajectory justifies additional capacity investment.
