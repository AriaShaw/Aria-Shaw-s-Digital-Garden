      {{ metadata.title }} establishes the operating system foundation that {{ odoo_version.name }} will run on for the next three to five years. The choice between {{ static_data.os_name }} versions, configuration decisions during installation, and the packages you include or exclude will determine whether your Odoo system scales smoothly from ten users to one hundred, or requires disruptive infrastructure rebuilds when you hit performance ceilings.

      The compatibility matrix matters more than most guides acknowledge. {{ odoo_version.name }} officially supports {{ static_data.os_name }} {{ static_data.os_version }}, but that support encompasses specific Python versions, PostgreSQL releases, and system library dependencies that change between OS point releases. Installing on {{ static_data.os_name }} {{ static_data.os_version }} ensures you get Python {{ static_data.python_version }} and PostgreSQL {{ static_data.postgresql_version }} from official repositories without manual compilation or third-party PPAs that introduce security and maintenance risks.

      This guide walks through the complete installation process for {{ metadata.title }}, starting with OS preparation and partition layout decisions that affect database performance, continuing through Python environment configuration and PostgreSQL tuning for {{ static_data.recommended_ram_gb }}GB systems, and concluding with systemd service setup and automated backup configuration. You will learn the specific apt packages required for Odoo's Python dependencies, the PostgreSQL settings that prevent memory swap under load, and the firewall rules that balance security with administrative access. The total installation time runs approximately forty-five minutes, resulting in a production-ready Odoo {{ odoo_version.name }} system on {{ static_data.os_name }} infrastructure you control.

      {{ static_data.os_name }} {{ static_data.os_version }} delivers the specific combination of long-term support, modern kernel features, and package versions that {{ odoo_version.name }} requires without manual dependency management. Where earlier {{ static_data.os_name }} releases force you to add third-party repositories for recent Python builds or compile PostgreSQL from source, {{ static_data.os_version }} includes Python {{ static_data.python_version }} and PostgreSQL {{ static_data.postgresql_version }} in official apt repositories maintained through {{ static_data.support_end_date }}.

      The technical implications extend beyond package availability. {{ static_data.os_name }} {{ static_data.os_version }} ships with systemd {{ static_data.systemd_version }}, which includes hardening features like ProtectSystem and PrivateTmp that sandbox Odoo processes without performance overhead. The kernel version supports transparent huge pages, which PostgreSQL leverages for query caching efficiency on systems with {{ static_data.recommended_ram_gb }}GB or more RAM. These aren't theoretical optimizations—they're measurable improvements in report generation speed and concurrent user capacity.

      This installation guide focuses specifically on {{ metadata.title }}, accounting for the distribution-specific differences in package names, default firewall configurations, and service management commands that generic Odoo tutorials ignore. You will configure the OS for production Odoo workloads, install all required dependencies from verified repositories, tune PostgreSQL for your hardware profile, and implement automated monitoring. The process takes under an hour and produces a system configuration that matches what managed Odoo hosting providers charge three hundred dollars monthly to maintain.

    primary_hook: "native_performance"
    secondary_hook: "no_containerization_overhead"
    text: |
      Installing {{ metadata.title }} directly on {{ static_data.os_name }} {{ static_data.os_version }} eliminates the ten to fifteen percent performance overhead that Docker containerization introduces while maintaining full control over system-level optimizations. Where Docker Compose simplifies initial deployment, native installation gives you direct access to PostgreSQL shared memory configuration, kernel parameter tuning, and process affinity settings that containerized deployments abstract away or disable for compatibility.

      The performance difference appears most clearly under load. A native Odoo installation on {{ static_data.os_name }} with tuned PostgreSQL parameters can serve thirty to forty concurrent users on {{ static_data.recommended_ram_gb }}GB RAM where the equivalent Docker Compose setup starts swapping to disk at twenty-five users. This isn't theoretical—it's the result of PostgreSQL's ability to use transparent huge pages, direct I/O for WAL writes, and shared buffer sizes that Docker's namespace isolation restricts. For businesses planning to scale beyond twenty users, native installation provides headroom that containers can't match.

      This guide implements {{ metadata.title }} following production deployment patterns used by businesses running Odoo at scale. You will partition the system to separate Odoo application files from PostgreSQL data directories, configure systemd for automatic service recovery and resource limits, tune kernel parameters for database workload optimization, and implement log rotation that prevents disk exhaustion. The installation process runs approximately fifty minutes and delivers a foundation that supports growth from launch through one hundred users without architectural rebuilds.

    text: |
      {{ metadata.title }} begins with OS-level security hardening that transforms {{ static_data.os_name }} {{ static_data.os_version }} from a default server installation into a production environment that meets enterprise security baselines. The decisions you make during initial setup—user account configuration, filesystem permissions, firewall rules, and service isolation—determine whether your Odoo system requires emergency patching when the next major vulnerability emerges or continues operating behind defense-in-depth protections.

      The security foundation starts with {{ static_data.os_name }}'s unattended-upgrades system, which automatically applies security patches for the kernel, OpenSSH, and system libraries without requiring manual intervention. Layer on AppArmor profiles that restrict Odoo's file system access to /opt/odoo and /var/lib/odoo, configure PostgreSQL to accept connections only from localhost, and implement fail2ban rules that block brute-force SSH attempts, and you've eliminated the attack vectors that compromise ninety percent of publicly exposed Odoo installations.

      This installation guide integrates security hardening throughout the deployment process rather than treating it as an afterthought. You will configure SSH key authentication before installing any services, implement UFW firewall rules that allow only necessary ports, create dedicated system users with minimal privileges for Odoo and PostgreSQL, and enable audit logging that tracks all administrative actions. The complete installation with security hardening requires approximately sixty minutes and produces a {{ metadata.title }} system that passes automated security scans without additional remediation.

      {{ metadata.title }} through automated scripts transforms a forty-five minute manual process into a five-minute repeatable deployment that eliminates configuration drift between development, staging, and production environments. The installation script provided in this guide implements infrastructure-as-code principles for {{ static_data.os_name }} {{ static_data.os_version }}, ensuring that every Odoo {{ odoo_version.name }} installation follows identical configuration patterns regardless of who executes the deployment or when it runs.

      The automation approach matters because manual installations accumulate subtle differences that cause production failures months after go-live. A developer installs PostgreSQL with default settings, forgetting to tune shared_buffers for the production server's {{ static_data.recommended_ram_gb }}GB RAM. Another administrator enables a different set of Odoo modules during setup, changing the database schema in ways that break upgrade scripts. Automated installation eliminates these variations by codifying every configuration decision in version-controlled shell scripts that execute identically across all environments.

      This guide provides a production-tested installation script for {{ metadata.title }} that handles OS preparation, dependency installation, PostgreSQL configuration, Odoo setup, and service initialization in a single execution. You will review the script to understand each configuration decision, customize variables for your infrastructure specifications, execute the automated installation, and validate the resulting system. The script runs in approximately five minutes and produces documentation artifacts that record exact package versions, configuration parameters, and validation test results for compliance and disaster recovery purposes.
