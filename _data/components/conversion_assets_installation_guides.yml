    headline: Optimize PostgreSQL for Your Workload
    body: 'Default PostgreSQL settings work for general workloads but leave performance
      on the table for Odoo-specific database usage patterns. You configured basic
      shared_buffers and work_mem during installation, but production optimization
      requires workload analysis and iterative tuning as your user count and module
      usage evolve.


      The **Operations Console** module includes `tune_postgresql_odoo.sh` and PostgreSQL
      optimization calculators that analyze your actual query patterns, recommend
      configuration changes for your specific hardware profile, and implement tuning
      safely with automated backup and rollback. The tuning process typically improves
      report generation speed by thirty to fifty percent and increases concurrent
      user capacity by twenty to thirty percent.

    headline: Harden Your Security Posture
    body: 'You implemented basic security during {{ metadata.title }}—SSH keys, UFW
      firewall, fail2ban. Production security requires defense-in-depth layers including
      intrusion detection, audit logging, automated vulnerability scanning, and incident
      response procedures that most installation guides ignore because they add complexity
      without visible functionality.


      The **Technical Architecture** module provides security hardening checklists,
      automated security audit scripts, intrusion detection setup guides for AIDE
      and OSSEC, and incident response playbooks. The security framework implements
      CIS benchmarks for {{ static_data.os_name }}, automating compliance verification
      and remediation.

    headline: Validate Production Readiness
    body: '{{ metadata.title }} completes the OS foundation, but production deployment
      requires validation across dozens of configuration points: backup restoration
      testing, monitoring setup, performance baseline establishment, security audit
      completion, disaster recovery documentation, and operational runbook creation.


      The **Master Pack** includes production readiness checklists that enumerate
      every validation step from infrastructure through application layer. The checklists
      identify gaps before you migrate production data, preventing the common failure
      mode where missing monitoring or untested backups cause preventable outages
      during your first month of production operation.

    body: 'You installed with working defaults, but PostgreSQL shared_buffers at 128MB
      on an 8GB system wastes 90% of available cache memory. Odoo worker counts at
      CPU*2 cause memory swapping under load. NGINX timeout defaults abort long-running
      reports. The Operations Console includes configuration calculators that optimize
      for your actual hardware and workload, not generic defaults.

    body: 'Without baseline metrics from day one, you can''t detect the gradual performance
      decay that kills production systems. PostgreSQL vacuum processes skip tables,
      indexes fragment, connection pools leak, disk I/O patterns shift—all invisible
      without monitoring. The Operations Console establishes baselines today while
      your system is fresh, making future degradation immediately visible.

    body: 'SSH keys and firewalls stop script kiddies, not determined attackers. Production
      security requires intrusion detection, file integrity monitoring, audit logging,
      and automated vulnerability scanning. The average breach detection time for
      insufficiently monitored systems is 197 days. The Master Pack''s security automation

      disappears when you switch contexts, team members change, or production incidents
      demand immediate action. The Master Pack''s runbook templates capture installation
