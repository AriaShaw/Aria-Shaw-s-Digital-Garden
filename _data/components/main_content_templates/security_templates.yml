template: 'Security vulnerabilities in {security_topic} emerge continuously as attackers discover new exploitation vectors.
  Organizations without systematic hardening procedures face data breaches, ransomware infections, and compliance violations
  that cost millions in remediation, legal fees, and reputational damage.


  The misconception that "we''re too small to be targeted" ignores automated attack tools scanning the entire internet for
  vulnerable systems. Attackers don''t manually select targets—they run automated scanners finding unpatched Odoo installations,
  weak passwords, exposed administrative interfaces, and misconfigured permissions. Your organization''s size provides no
  protection against automated exploitation.


  ## Threat Landscape and Attack Vectors


  {security_context}


  Common attack vectors targeting Odoo installations include SQL injection through improperly sanitized user inputs, XML-RPC
  authentication brute-forcing against exposed ports, session hijacking through unencrypted HTTP connections, privilege escalation
  via misconfigured access rights, and supply chain attacks through compromised third-party modules.


  Defense requires layered security—multiple independent controls so single point failures don''t compromise the entire system.
  If attackers breach the first layer (network firewall), the second layer (application authentication) still prevents access.
  If they bypass authentication (stolen credentials), the third layer (access controls) limits damage scope.


  ## Security Hardening Checklist


  {security_hardening_steps}


  **Network Security**: Close port 8069 to public internet after configuring reverse proxy—direct Odoo access bypasses SSL/TLS
  encryption, rate limiting, and request filtering provided by NGINX or Apache. Configure firewall rules allowing only reverse
  proxy to Odoo backend (localhost:8069 or 127.0.0.1:8069).


  **Authentication Security**: Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all administrative accounts through the auth_totp
  module. Configure password policies requiring minimum 12 characters, uppercase/lowercase mix, numbers, and special characters.
  Disable default admin account after creating named administrator accounts for audit trail purposes.


  **Access Control Security**: Review user access rights quarterly removing unnecessary permissions accumulated through role
  changes. Apply principle of least privilege—users receive minimum permissions required for job functions. Separate administrative
  privileges from operational access preventing accidental system modifications.


  **Data Encryption**: Enable database encryption at rest for compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS regulations. Configure
  SSL/TLS 1.3 for transport encryption with strong cipher suites (ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384 or better). Encrypt backup files
  before uploading to cloud storage—unencrypted backups create compliance violations and data breach risks.


  **Module Security**: Install only verified modules from trusted sources—Odoo Apps store, reputable vendors, or internally
  developed code. Review module permissions carefully before installation—modules requesting unnecessary database access or
  file system permissions may contain malware. Keep module inventory documenting version numbers, update dates, and security
  patch status.


  ## Vulnerability Management


  {vulnerability_management_process}


  Establish vulnerability monitoring subscribing to Odoo security advisories, CVE databases, and security researcher blogs.
  When vulnerabilities are announced, assess impact on your installation—does the vulnerability affect modules you use? Are
  there compensating controls already in place? Can you mitigate through configuration changes before patches become available?


  Test security patches in staging environments before production deployment. Patches occasionally introduce regressions breaking
  functionality—discover these in staging, not production. Document patch testing procedures: backup production data, restore
  to staging, apply patches, execute test scripts covering critical workflows, verify no functionality breaks.


  Implement automated vulnerability scanning using tools like Nessus, OpenVAS, or Qualys. Schedule weekly scans identifying
  new vulnerabilities introduced through system changes. Configure alerting notifying security teams immediately when critical
  vulnerabilities emerge.


  ## Compliance Requirements


  {compliance_specific_requirements}


  **GDPR Compliance** (European Union): Implement user consent management tracking explicit permission for data collection.
  Provide data export functionality allowing users to download their personal information. Create data deletion procedures
  permanently removing user data on request. Document data processing activities in Records of Processing Activities (ROPA).


  **HIPAA Compliance** (US Healthcare): Encrypt Protected Health Information (PHI) at rest and in transit. Implement comprehensive
  audit logging recording all PHI access. Create Business Associate Agreements (BAA) with hosting providers and third-party
  processors. Conduct annual risk assessments documenting security controls.


  **PCI-DSS Compliance** (Payment Card Industry): Never store full credit card numbers, CVV codes, or PINs in Odoo database—use
  tokenization through payment processors. Segment cardholder data environment (CDE) from other systems through network isolation.
  Conduct quarterly vulnerability scans and annual penetration testing by approved scanning vendors (ASV).


  **SOC 2 Compliance**: Document security policies covering access control, change management, incident response, and vendor
  management. Implement security controls matching documented policies. Conduct annual SOC 2 Type II audits validating controls
  operate effectively throughout examination period.


  ## Incident Response Procedures


  {incident_response_plan}


  Security incidents follow predictable patterns: detection, containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident analysis.
  Document procedures for each phase before incidents occur—during active compromises, teams need clear instructions, not
  improvisation.


  **Detection Phase**: Monitor security logs for indicators of compromise—failed authentication attempts from unusual locations,
  privilege escalation attempts, unauthorized data access, unusual network traffic patterns. Configure SIEM (Security Information
  and Event Management) systems aggregating logs from firewalls, intrusion detection systems, application servers, and databases
  for correlation analysis.


  **Containment Phase**: Isolate compromised systems preventing lateral movement to other infrastructure. Disable compromised
  user accounts. Block malicious IP addresses at firewall. Capture forensic evidence (memory dumps, network traffic, system
  snapshots) before remediation destroys indicators.


  **Eradication Phase**: Remove malware, close vulnerability exploited for initial access, reset compromised passwords, revoke
  exposed API keys. Verify attacker access completely removed before restoring services—premature restoration allows attackers
  to regain access through undetected backdoors.


  **Recovery Phase**: Restore systems from known-good backups predating compromise. Verify restored systems remain uncompromised
  through vulnerability scans and integrity checks. Gradually restore services monitoring for signs of persistent compromise.


  **Post-Incident Analysis**: Document attack timeline, initial access vector, data accessed, vulnerabilities exploited, and
  detection failures. Implement corrective actions preventing recurrence—patch vulnerabilities, improve monitoring, update
  incident response procedures based on lessons learned.


  ## Security Monitoring and Auditing


  {security_monitoring_details}


  Comprehensive logging captures security-relevant events for forensic analysis and compliance reporting. Configure Odoo to
  log authentication attempts (successful and failed), authorization decisions, data exports, configuration changes, user
  creation/deletion, and API access. Retain logs for minimum 90 days (compliance requirements often mandate 1-7 years).


  Implement real-time alerting for high-risk events: multiple failed authentication attempts, access outside normal hours,
  privilege escalation, mass data export, security configuration changes. Configure alert thresholds balancing sensitivity
  (detecting actual threats) against specificity (minimizing false positives).


  Review audit logs weekly identifying security anomalies and policy violations. Look for privilege creep (users gradually
  accumulating unnecessary permissions), abandoned accounts (former employees retaining access), sharing credentials (multiple
  users logging in from same account), and suspicious access patterns.


  ## Continuous Security Improvement


  Security requires ongoing investment—new vulnerabilities emerge, attack techniques evolve, and compliance requirements expand.
  Schedule quarterly security reviews assessing control effectiveness and identifying gaps requiring remediation.


  Conduct annual penetration testing simulating attacker tactics identifying vulnerabilities before exploitation. Engage professional
  security firms providing external perspective and specialized expertise. Test both external attack surface (internet-facing
  systems) and internal networks (compromised employee scenario).


  Implement security training programs educating employees about phishing, social engineering, password security, and incident
  reporting. Human vulnerabilities often prove easier to exploit than technical systems—attackers phish credentials rather
  than brute-forcing encryption.


  {security_conclusion}


  The security landscape continuously evolves requiring vigilance and adaptation. Organizations treating security as one-time
  project rather than ongoing process discover vulnerabilities only after exploitation. Invest in preventive security now
  or pay exponentially more for incident response, regulatory fines, and reputational recovery later.'
