    template: 'Configuring {feature_name} in Odoo {odoo_version} requires understanding
      the relationship between company-level settings, user permissions, and transactional
      workflows before clicking Save on configuration screens that affect every user''s
      daily operations. Incorrect {feature_name} configuration forces workarounds
      that compound into permanent operational inefficiencies—users develop habits
      around system limitations that persist even after you fix the underlying configuration.


      The configuration process follows a hierarchical structure where high-level
      settings constrain subsequent options. Company-level configurations establish
      boundaries for all users and transactions. User group permissions determine
      which employees access which features. Transaction-level settings customize
      behavior for specific document types. Configuring in the wrong order creates
      contradictions that generate cryptic error messages and unexpected behavior.


      ## Configuration Prerequisites and Dependencies


      {feature_name} depends on several prerequisite modules and configurations. {prerequisite_modules}


      Verify these dependencies exist before attempting {feature_name} configuration.
      Missing prerequisites cause configuration screens to display incomplete options
      or error messages about undefined fields. The error messages don''t explicitly
      state which prerequisite is missing—you must deduce this from Odoo''s dependency
      chain.


      ## Company-Level Configuration


      Navigate to Settings > Companies and select your company record. The {feature_name}
      configuration section appears under {settings_location}. {company_config_specifics}


      Company-level settings apply globally to all users and transactions unless explicitly
      overridden by user group permissions or transaction-specific configurations.
      Think carefully before enabling company-wide settings—disabling them later requires
      data migration to handle records created while the setting was active.


      {feature_specific_company_settings}


      Test company-level changes in a development environment first. Some settings
      trigger database migrations that take minutes or hours to complete based on
      transaction volume. Running these migrations in production during business hours
      creates unexpected downtime.


      ## User Permissions and Access Rights


      {feature_name} functionality requires specific user group assignments. Navigate
      to Settings > Users & Companies > Groups and review the {relevant_groups} groups.
      {permission_specifics}


      The permission model follows a hierarchical structure where higher-level groups
      include all permissions from lower-level groups. Granting "Manager" access automatically
      includes "User" permissions—you don''t need to assign both. However, custom
      permission configurations can break this hierarchy if you modify out-of-box
      group definitions.


      Test permissions with actual user accounts, not the administrator account. Administrators
      bypass many permission checks, creating false confidence that configuration
      works when normal users will encounter access denied errors. Create test accounts
      for each user role and verify they can perform required operations.


      ## Feature-Specific Configuration


      {feature_name} provides numerous configuration options that customize behavior
      for your business processes. {feature_detailed_config}


      Document every configuration change with business justification and expected
      impact. Configuration screens don''t provide change history or rollback capability—if
      a setting change causes problems, you must remember the previous value to restore
      it. Maintain a configuration change log in a shared document accessible to the
      entire implementation team.


      ## Integration with Other Modules


      {feature_name} integrates with other Odoo modules that may require additional
      configuration. {integration_requirements}


      Test integrations explicitly—don''t assume they work because individual modules
      function correctly. Create test scenarios that span multiple modules: create
      a sales order that triggers inventory picking that updates accounting entries.
      Verify the complete workflow before declaring configuration complete.


      ## Workflow Configuration


      {feature_name} workflows define how records progress through business process
      stages. {workflow_specifics}


      Workflow stages should reflect your actual business process, not Odoo''s default
      assumptions. If your sales process requires manager approval for discounts exceeding
      10%, configure approval workflows rather than training users to manually notify
      managers. Automated workflow enforcement prevents process bypassing that occurs
      when workflows exist only in employee training materials.


      ## Validation Rules and Constraints


      Configure validation rules to prevent data entry errors at transaction creation
      time rather than discovering problems during reports. {validation_config_specifics}


      Validation rules should be strict enough to prevent obvious errors but flexible
      enough to handle legitimate edge cases. Rules that are too restrictive force
      users to enter dummy data to bypass validation, defeating the purpose. Test
      validation rules with real historical data to identify edge cases that require
      rule adjustments.


      ## Reporting and Analytics Configuration


      Configure {feature_name} reports to match your business reporting requirements.
      {reporting_config_details}


      Custom report configurations should match your existing reporting templates
      to minimize disruption for stakeholders consuming reports. If your CFO expects
      gross profit calculations to exclude shipping revenue, configure reports identically—don''t
      force stakeholders to adapt to Odoo''s calculation methods.


      ## Testing Configuration Changes


      Create a comprehensive test plan covering all {feature_name} workflows. {testing_specifics}


      Test with real production data volumes, not 5-10 sample records. Configuration
      that works with sample data often fails at scale due to query timeout issues,
      memory exhaustion, or UI slowdowns when dropdown lists contain thousands of
      options.


      ## Common Configuration Mistakes


      **Configuring permissions too restrictively**: Users cannot perform legitimate
      operations and submit support tickets for every exception. This creates administrative
      burden and user frustration. Start with permissive settings and tighten based
      on actual security requirements, not theoretical worst-case scenarios.


      **Ignoring performance implications**: Configuration options that seem innocuous
      in testing devastate performance in production. Enabling audit trails on high-volume
      transaction tables generates gigabytes of log data daily and slows queries by
      40-60%.


      **Not documenting custom configurations**: Six months after go-live, users ask
      why a feature behaves differently than documented in Odoo''s official guides.
      Without configuration documentation, diagnosing customizations versus bugs wastes
      hours of troubleshooting time.


      **Changing production configuration without testing**: "This is a small change,
      we don''t need to test it" becomes the cause of the next production outage.
      Always test configuration changes in staging environments, even apparently trivial
      ones. Edge cases and integration impacts aren''t obvious without testing.

    template: '## Understanding {feature_name} in Odoo {odoo_version}


      {feature_name} configuration directly impacts revenue generation, sales team
      productivity, and customer relationship management effectiveness. Unlike generic
      settings that affect back-office operations, {feature_name} changes immediately
      alter how sales representatives interact with customers, how pricing calculations
      execute, and how leads progress through qualification stages.


      {feature_specific_intro}


      ## {feature_name} Configuration Workflow


      {feature_setup_workflow}


      ### Prerequisites and Module Dependencies


      {feature_name} requires specific Odoo modules installed and configured before
      accessing configuration screens:


      {prerequisite_configuration}


      Navigate to Apps, search for required modules, and click Install. Odoo automatically
      installs dependencies, but verify all prerequisite modules show "Installed"
      status before proceeding with {feature_name} configuration.


      ## Core Configuration Settings


      {core_settings_section}


      ### Computation Engine and Business Rules


      {computation_rules}


      ### Automation and Workflow Triggers


      {automation_configuration}


      ## Advanced Configuration Options


      {advanced_options}


      ### Integration with Sales Processes


      {sales_integration}


      Test integrations systematically: create sample sales order, verify {feature_name}
      applies correctly, check resulting invoice and accounting entries. Integration
      failures often manifest as incorrect pricing on invoices or missing CRM activity
      logging.


      ## User Access and Permission Configuration


      {feature_name} permissions follow Odoo''s role-based access control model. Navigate
      to Settings > Users & Companies > Groups to configure access levels:


      {permission_matrix}


      Create test user accounts for each role and verify permissions work correctly.
      Administrator accounts bypass permission checks, creating false confidence that
      configuration succeeds when normal users encounter access denied errors.


      ## Performance Optimization and Best Practices


      {performance_optimization}


      ### Reporting and Analytics Configuration


      Configure {feature_name} reporting to track key performance indicators relevant
      to your sales strategy:


      {reporting_configuration}


      Custom reports should mirror existing business reporting templates. If your
      sales director expects win rate calculated excluding unqualified leads, configure
      reports identically rather than forcing stakeholders to adapt to Odoo''s default
      calculation methods.


      ## Common Configuration Mistakes and Solutions


      {common_mistakes}


      ### Testing and Validation Checklist


      Before declaring {feature_name} configuration complete, validate these scenarios
      with real production data volumes:


      {validation_checklist}


      Configuration that performs well with 50 test records often fails at production
      scale (10,000+ records) due to database query timeouts, memory exhaustion, or
      UI slowdowns when dropdown lists contain thousands of customers or products.

        default: This configuration feature plays a critical role in Odoo's operational
          functionality. Proper configuration ensures seamless integration with your
          business processes and delivers expected outcomes. Misconfiguration creates
          operational friction that compounds into permanent inefficiencies, forcing
          users to develop workarounds that persist even after the underlying issue
          is fixed. Configuration decisions made here affect all users and transactions

          prevents unexpected pricing behavior.


          **Rule Priority Hierarchy**:

          1. **Customer-specific pricelist** (highest priority): Individual customer
          overrides

          2. **Customer group pricelist**: Segment-based pricing (wholesale, retail,
          VIP)

          3. **Public pricelist** (lowest priority): Default pricing for all customers


          **Formula Syntax for Advanced Pricing**:

          ```python

          # Cost-plus with minimum margin

          price = max(cost * 1.3, cost + 50)  # 30% margin OR $50 minimum

        Pricelists Configuration: Optimize pricelist performance by minimizing rule
          count (consolidate similar rules), using product categories instead of individual
          product rules, and avoiding complex formula calculations for high-volume
          products. Index pricelist-related database fields for faster query performance.
        default: Optimize performance by configuring appropriate database indexes,
          limiting automated action frequency, and archiving old records that no longer
          require active processing. Monitor system performance after configuration
          changes to identify bottlenecks. Large-scale deployments may require infrastructure

      generic feature configurations that affect isolated workflows, {feature_name}
      changes propagate through purchasing, sales, manufacturing, and accounting modules—a
      misconfigured inventory setting cascades into incorrect cost of goods sold calculations,
      stock discrepancies that force physical inventory counts, and fulfillment delays
      that damage customer relationships.


      {feature_specific_intro}


      ## {feature_name} Configuration Workflow


      {feature_setup_workflow}


      ### Prerequisites and Module Dependencies


      {feature_name} requires specific Odoo modules and base configurations before
      accessing full functionality:


      {prerequisite_configuration}


      Navigate to Apps > search for prerequisite modules > Install. Odoo resolves
      dependencies automatically, but verify each prerequisite shows "Installed" status.
      Missing dependencies cause configuration screens to display incomplete field
      options or throw cryptic validation errors that don''t explicitly state which
      module is missing.


      ## Core Configuration Settings


      {core_settings_section}


      Odoo''s location hierarchy determines how inventory moves between physical and
      virtual locations. Location types (View, Internal, Customer, Vendor, Inventory,
      Production, Transit) control stock valuation and accounting integration. Internal
      locations contribute to on-hand inventory quantities and trigger stock valuation
      entries. Virtual locations (Customer, Vendor) represent external parties and
      affect accounts receivable/payable rather than inventory asset accounts.


      ## Automation and Workflow Configuration


      {automation_configuration}


      ### Inventory Valuation and Costing Methods


      {valuation_configuration}


      Changing valuation methods after significant transaction history requires complex
      data migration and manual accounting adjustments. Consult with your accounting
      team before finalizing valuation configuration—GAAP and IFRS impose restrictions
      on when companies can change valuation methods.


      ## Advanced Configuration Options


      {advanced_options}


      ### Integration with Other Modules


      {feature_name} integrates with purchasing, sales, manufacturing, and accounting
      modules. Configuration changes propagate across integrations:


      {module_integration}


      Test integrations end-to-end: create purchase order > receive inventory > create
      sales order > deliver to customer > verify accounting entries. Integration failures
      manifest as missing stock moves, incorrect valuations, or accounting entry gaps.


      ## User Access and Permission Configuration


      {feature_name} permissions control which users can perform stock adjustments,
      view inventory valuations, or modify warehouse configurations:


      {permission_matrix}


      Segregate duties between warehouse operators (who perform physical movements)
      and inventory controllers (who adjust valuations and run physical counts). Combined
      permissions create fraud risk and compliance violations.


      ## Performance Optimization and Best Practices


      {performance_optimization}


      ### Reporting and Analytics Configuration


      Configure {feature_name} reporting to provide visibility into stock levels,
      movement history, and valuation accuracy:


      {reporting_configuration}


      Custom reports should match existing warehouse management reporting templates.
      If your operations team expects inventory turnover calculated excluding safety
      stock, configure reports identically rather than forcing operational changes
      to match Odoo''s default calculation logic.


      ## Common Configuration Mistakes and Solutions


      {common_mistakes}


      ### Testing and Validation Checklist


      Before declaring {feature_name} configuration complete, validate these scenarios
      with production data volumes:


      {validation_checklist}


      Configuration that performs adequately with 1,000 stock moves often fails at
      100,000+ moves due to database query timeouts, report generation failures, or
      UI slowdowns when selecting locations/products from dropdown lists containing
      thousands of records.

      {feature_specific_intro}


      ## {feature_name} Configuration Workflow


      {feature_setup_workflow}


      ### Prerequisites and Module Dependencies


      {feature_name} requires specific Odoo modules and base configurations before
      accessing full functionality:


      {prerequisite_configuration}


      Navigate to Apps > search for prerequisite modules > Install. Odoo resolves
      dependencies automatically, but verify each prerequisite shows "Installed" status.
      Missing accounting dependencies cause configuration screens to display incomplete
      field options, throw validation errors during transaction posting, or create
      journal entries with incorrect account mappings.


      ## Core Configuration Settings


      {core_settings_section}


      Accounting configurations establish company-level defaults that constrain all
      financial transactions. Changes to core settings after go-live require data
      migration to reconcile historical transactions with new configuration rules—plan
      configuration carefully during implementation to minimize post-launch changes.


      ## Automation and Workflow Configuration


      {automation_configuration}


      ### Financial Controls and Validation Rules


      {valuation_configuration}


      Financial control configurations prevent posting errors before they enter the
      general ledger. Preventive controls (validation rules, required fields, account
      reconciliation requirements) cost less than detective controls (periodic reconciliations,
      variance analysis) because they stop errors at transaction entry rather than
      discovering them during month-end close.


      ## Advanced Configuration Options


      {advanced_options}


      ### Integration with Other Modules


      {feature_name} integrates with Sales (revenue recognition), Inventory (cost
      of goods sold), Purchasing (accounts payable), and HR (payroll accruals). Configuration
      changes propagate across integrations:


      {module_integration}


      Test integrations systematically: create sales order > ship inventory > generate
      invoice > receive payment > verify accounting entries match expected debits/credits.
      Integration failures manifest as missing journal entries, incorrect account
      coding, or timing differences between module transactions and accounting records.


      ## User Access and Permission Configuration


      {feature_name} permissions control which users can post journal entries, modify
      account reconciliations, or access sensitive financial data:


      {permission_matrix}


      Implement segregation of duties: users who create transactions should not approve
      them, users who approve invoices should not process payments, users who reconcile
      accounts should not post manual journal entries. Combined permissions create
      fraud risk and audit control deficiencies.


      ## Performance Optimization and Best Practices


      {performance_optimization}


      ### Reporting and Analytics Configuration


      Configure {feature_name} reporting to provide visibility into financial position,
      performance trends, and compliance metrics:


      {reporting_configuration}


      Financial reports should match existing financial statement formats to minimize
      disruption for stakeholders consuming reports. If your CFO expects EBITDA calculated
      excluding stock compensation expense, configure reports identically rather than
      forcing finance team to create manual reconciliations between Odoo reports and
      board presentations.


      ## Common Configuration Mistakes and Solutions


      {common_mistakes}


      ### Testing and Validation Checklist


      Before declaring {feature_name} configuration complete, validate these scenarios
      with production-scale data:


      {validation_checklist}


      Configuration that produces accurate financial statements with 1,000 transactions
      often fails at 100,000+ transactions due to database query timeouts during financial
      close, report generation failures on multi-entity consolidations, or UI slowdowns
      when selecting from dropdown lists containing thousands of GL accounts or cost
      centers.

        Accounting Chart Of Accounts: 'Chart of accounts configuration establishes
          the foundational GL account structure that categorizes all financial transactions,
          determines financial statement presentation, and enables compliance reporting.
          Chart design decisions are effectively permanent—restructuring accounts
          after transaction history exists requires complex data migration, historical
          restatement, and external auditor coordination that often exceeds initial
          implementation costs.

        Accounting Consolidation: 'Accounting Consolidation configuration directly
          impacts financial reporting accuracy, compliance obligations, and audit

          require expensive remediation—proper configuration prevents compliance issues
          before they trigger regulatory scrutiny or financial restatement.

        Bank Reconciliation: 'Bank reconciliation configuration automates matching
          of bank statement transactions to accounting records, identifying timing
          differences, uncoded deposits, and potential errors requiring investigation.
          Automated reconciliation reduces month-end close time from days to hours
          while improving cash position accuracy—manual reconciliation scales poorly
          as transaction volume grows, creating close bottlenecks that delay financial
          reporting and management decision-making.

        default: This configuration feature plays a critical role in Odoo's operational
          functionality. Proper configuration ensures seamless integration with your
          business processes and delivers expected outcomes. Misconfiguration creates
          operational friction that compounds into permanent inefficiencies, forcing
          users to develop workarounds that persist even after the underlying issue

        Product Variants: Product variant configuration enables offering multiple
          versions of products without creating separate records for each combination.
          Misconfigured variants create inventory nightmares and customer confusion.
        Shipping Methods: Shipping method configuration determines delivery options
          and cost calculations at checkout. Misconfigured shipping blocks orders
          or creates unexpected costs.
        Coupon Codes: Coupon code configuration controls promotional discounts and
          usage restrictions. Misconfigured coupons create revenue leakage or customer
          frustration.
        Abandoned Cart: Abandoned cart recovery automates email campaigns for incomplete
          checkouts. Poor configuration sends too many or too few recovery emails.
        default: This configuration feature plays a critical role in Odoo's operational
          functionality. Proper configuration ensures seamless integration with your
          business processes and delivers expected outcomes. Misconfiguration creates
          operational friction that compounds into permanent inefficiencies, forcing
          users to develop workarounds that persist even after the underlying issue
          is fixed. Configuration decisions made here affect all users and transactions
          across the system.

        Abandoned Cart: Set abandonment time threshold, email template design, send
          schedule, and exclusion rules in cart recovery configuration.
        default: Configuration options are accessible through the module's Configuration
          menu. Key settings include enabling/disabling feature flags, defining default
          values, establishing validation rules, and customizing behavior to match
          your business requirements. Configuration changes typically apply at company
          level unless explicitly scoped to user groups or specific records. Review
          each setting carefully as changes affect system-wide behavior.

          method calculation > promotional discounts > final cart total.'
        Coupon Codes: 'Discount application order: product promotions > coupon discounts
          > customer pricelists. Validate code before applying.'
        Abandoned Cart: System identifies abandoned carts after configured time threshold
          and triggers email sequence based on schedule.
        default: Configuration follows standard Odoo patterns with settings organized
          hierarchically. Company-level settings establish system-wide defaults that
          apply to all users and transactions. User group permissions control access
          to configuration screens and feature usage. Transaction-level settings override
          company defaults when specific behavior is required for individual records.
      performance_optimization:
        Product Variants: Index variant attribute fields for fast filtering. Lazy
          load variant images. Monitor query time on category pages with many variants.
        Shipping Methods: Cache shipping rate calculations. Set reasonable cache expiration
          balancing freshness vs performance.
        Coupon Codes: Test checkout performance with complex discount rules. Immediate
          calculation provides confidence but adds processing time.
        Abandoned Cart: Schedule cart recovery emails during off-peak hours to avoid
          system load during high traffic periods.
        default: Optimize performance by configuring appropriate database indexes,
          limiting automated action frequency, and archiving old records that no longer
          require active processing. Monitor system performance after configuration
          changes to identify bottlenecks. Large-scale deployments may require infrastructure
          scaling.
      common_mistakes:
        Product Variants: Avoid generating all possible attribute combinations automatically.
          Create variants manually for actual product offerings only.
        Shipping Methods: Validate actual shipping costs before setting flat rates.
          Configure weight-based overrides for heavy items.
        Coupon Codes: Configure coupon mutual exclusivity to prevent stacking that
          destroys margins. Set both validity date AND usage limit.
        Abandoned Cart: Balance email frequency - neither too annoying nor missing
          recovery window. Exclude already-purchased carts.
        default: Common configuration errors include enabling features without prerequisite
          modules, configuring in wrong order (company settings before user permissions),
          skipping testing phase with non-production data, and failing to document
          configuration decisions for future reference. These mistakes create issues
          that are difficult to diagnose and require time-consuming rollback procedures.
      validation_checklist:
        Product Variants: Test variant selection UI on mobile. Verify inventory decrements
          at variant level. Confirm variant images update correctly.
        Shipping Methods: Process test orders to all destination types. Verify costs
          match carrier rates. Test free shipping threshold triggers.
        Coupon Codes: Test all coupon codes for correct validation. Verify discount
          calculations. Confirm usage limits enforce correctly.
        Abandoned Cart: Verify recovery emails send at correct intervals. Test exclusion
          rules work. Monitor recovery rate metrics.

    variable_mappings:
      feature_specific_intro:
        Project Timesheet: Project timesheet configuration determines how time entries
          are captured, validated, approved, and billed to customers. Misconfigured
          timesheets create billing disputes, revenue leakage from unbilled hours,
          and project profitability reporting errors that mask actual project performance.
        Project Billing: Project billing configuration controls how time, expenses,
          and milestones translate into customer invoices. Incorrect billing rules
          create revenue recognition errors, undercharge customers by missing billable
          items, or damage client relationships through billing disputes requiring
          manual corrections.
        Expense Management: Expense management configuration defines submission workflows,
          approval hierarchies, expense categories, and reimbursement processing.
          Incorrect expense configuration creates compliance violations, duplicate
          reimbursements, policy enforcement failures, and financial reporting errors.
        Leave Management: Leave management configuration defines time-off policies,
          accrual rules, approval workflows, and calendar integration. Misconfigured
          leave systems create payroll errors, compliance violations with labor laws,
          scheduling conflicts, and employee dissatisfaction from policy inconsistencies.
        Performance Appraisal: Performance appraisal configuration defines review
          cycles, evaluation criteria, goal tracking, and feedback workflows. Poor
          appraisal configuration creates subjective bias in evaluations, incomplete
          performance documentation for employment decisions, goal misalignment across
          organization, and legal vulnerabilities in termination processes.
        Payroll Configuration: Payroll configuration establishes salary structures,
          tax calculation rules, benefit deductions, and payment processing automation.
          Misconfigured payroll creates tax compliance failures triggering penalties,
          incorrect net pay calculations damaging employee trust, benefit deduction
          errors, and financial reporting inaccuracies.
        default: This configuration feature plays a critical role in Odoo's operational

          workflow routing rules. Each decision affects system behavior and should
          be documented for future reference.
      automation_logic:
        Project Timesheet: Automated actions populate tasks from sales orders, send
          timesheet submission reminders, lock timesheets after approval deadline,
          generate draft invoices from approved timesheets, and alert managers of
          missing timesheet entries.
        Project Billing: Automation creates invoices from approved timesheets and
          expenses, applies prepaid service deductions, generates milestone-based
          invoices on completion, sends billing notifications to customers, and creates
          revenue recognition journal entries.
        Expense Management: Automation extracts data from receipt images, categorizes
          expenses using machine learning, calculates mileage reimbursements from
          GPS data, converts foreign currency expenses, and sends expense report submission
          reminders.
        Leave Management: Automated workflows calculate leave accruals each pay period,
          send leave balance notifications, route approval requests to managers, update
          team calendars on approval, and trigger payroll adjustments for unpaid leave.
        Performance Appraisal: Automation launches review cycles on schedule, sends
          assessment reminders to employees and managers, calculates aggregate performance
          scores, generates performance distribution reports, creates performance
          improvement plans for low ratings, and archives completed reviews.
        Payroll Configuration: Automated processes import timesheet hours, calculate
          gross pay from salary structures, compute tax withholdings, process benefit
          deductions, generate direct deposit files, create payroll journal entries,
          and send payslip notifications.
        default: Automated actions execute based on record triggers, field value changes,
          or scheduled timing. Configure automation carefully to prevent infinite
          loops, ensure idempotent operations, and handle error conditions gracefully.
      integration_modules:
        Project Timesheet: Sales (service contracts), Accounting (revenue recognition),
          Invoicing (billing generation), HR (employee rates), and Projects (task
          tracking)
        Project Billing: Sales (quotations and orders), Timesheets (billable hours),
          Expenses (billable costs), Accounting (invoice posting), and Subscriptions
          (recurring revenue)
        Expense Management: Accounting (expense posting), Projects (project costs),
          Timesheets (billable expenses), Employees (approver hierarchy), and Invoicing
          (expense billing)
        Leave Management: Employees (leave balances), Calendar (availability), Payroll
          (leave pay), Timesheets (absence tracking), and Approvals (request routing)
        Performance Appraisal: Employees (review participants), Goals (objective setting),

          (merit increase linking)
        Payroll Configuration: Employees (master data), Accounting (payroll posting),
          Timesheets (hours worked), Leave (paid time off), and Banking (direct deposit)
        default: Integration with core Odoo modules and may require third-party module
          installation for extended functionality. Verify module compatibility with
          your Odoo version before enabling integration features.
      common_pitfall:
        Project Timesheet: Failing to configure timesheet locking causes approved
          entries to be modified retroactively, breaking billing integrity and requiring
          invoice corrections. Enable automatic locking of approved periods.
        Project Billing: Mixing billing types on a single project (e.g., time and
          materials plus fixed price) creates revenue recognition confusion. Use separate
          project phases or sale orders for different billing methods.
        Expense Management: Not enforcing receipt attachment requirements allows policy
          violations and creates audit trail gaps. Make receipt upload mandatory for
          all expense categories.
        Leave Management: Configuring unlimited negative leave balances allows employees
          to accrue leave debt that becomes financial liability on termination. Set
          maximum negative balance limits.
        Performance Appraisal: Running performance reviews during year-end holidays
          causes rushed evaluations and low completion rates. Schedule review cycles
          for non-holiday periods.
        Payroll Configuration: Processing payroll without thorough testing creates
          mass employee payment errors affecting morale and requiring emergency corrections.
          Test with sample employees first.
        default: The most common configuration mistake is incomplete prerequisite
          setup. Verify all dependent modules are installed, company settings are
          configured, and user permissions are assigned before attempting configuration.
          Skipping prerequisites causes cryptic error messages that are difficult
          to diagnose.
      troubleshooting_tips:
        Project Timesheet: If timesheets do not generate invoices, verify task is
          linked to sale order line, timesheet is approved and not locked for billing,
          billing type is correctly configured, and user has invoicing permissions.
        Project Billing: If invoices show incorrect amounts, check billing rate source
          priority, timesheet rounding rules, prepaid service balance, expense billability
          flags, and revenue recognition method.
        Expense Management: If expenses do not post to accounting, verify expense
          category maps to chart of accounts, expense is approved, accounting integration
          is enabled, and journal entry dates are valid.
        Leave Management: If leave balances are incorrect, check accrual rule start
          date matches hire date, leave type is correctly configured, carryover rules
          applied properly, and manual adjustments were not made in error.
        Performance Appraisal: If appraisal cycle does not launch, verify review period
          dates are configured, employee population filter is correct, appraisal template
          is active, and automated scheduled action ran successfully.
        Payroll Configuration: If payslips show zero amounts, check employee contract
          is active during pay period, salary structure is assigned, payroll rules
          are configured, and timesheet/attendance data is imported.
        default: 'If configuration does not behave as expected: (1) Check server logs
          for error messages, (2) Verify user has required permissions, (3) Confirm
          prerequisite modules are installed, (4) Test in developer mode to see detailed
          error information, (5) Review recent configuration changes that might have
          introduced the issue.'

    variable_mappings:
      feature_specific_intro:
        Point Of Sale Offline Mode: Offline mode configuration ensures uninterrupted
          sales operations when internet connectivity fails. Misconfigured offline
          mode causes transaction loss during network outages, data synchronization
          conflicts when reconnecting, inventory discrepancies from unsynchronized
          sales, and customer checkout delays requiring manual fallback procedures.
        Point Of Sale Hardware Setup: POS hardware configuration integrates receipt
          printers, barcode scanners, cash drawers, payment terminals, and customer
          displays with Odoo. Incorrect hardware setup causes checkout delays from
          device failures, payment processing errors from terminal misconfiguration,
          receipt printing failures frustrating customers, and cash handling errors
          from drawer integration issues.
        Point Of Sale Receipt Customization: Receipt customization configuration controls
          branding, layout, information displayed, and legal compliance of printed
          receipts. Poor receipt configuration creates brand inconsistency damaging
          professional image, missing legal requirements triggering compliance violations,
          customer confusion from unclear receipt information, and support burden
          from receipt-related questions.
        Point Of Sale Loyalty: Loyalty program configuration defines point earning
          rules, redemption workflows, reward tiers, and customer engagement automation.
          Misconfigured loyalty programs create customer dissatisfaction from point
          calculation errors, redemption failures at checkout causing transaction
          abandonment, tier misclassification losing customer trust, and promotional
          ineffectiveness from rule configuration errors.
        default: This configuration feature plays a critical role in Odoo's operational
          functionality. Proper configuration ensures seamless integration with your
          business processes and delivers expected outcomes. Misconfiguration creates
          operational friction that compounds into permanent inefficiencies, forcing
          users to develop workarounds that persist even after the underlying issue
          is fixed. Configuration decisions made here affect all users and transactions
          across the system.
      business_impact:
        Point Of Sale Offline Mode: store continuity during network failures, data
          integrity during synchronization, and customer experience during connectivity
          issues
        Point Of Sale Hardware Setup: checkout speed, payment reliability, receipt
          printing consistency, and overall customer transaction experience
        Point Of Sale Receipt Customization: brand perception, regulatory compliance,
          customer communication, and return processing efficiency
        Point Of Sale Loyalty: customer retention rates, repeat purchase frequency,
          promotional effectiveness, and customer lifetime value
        default: Proper configuration directly affects operational efficiency and
          business outcomes. Proper configuration reduces manual work, improves data
          accuracy, and accelerates process completion. Misconfiguration creates bottlenecks,
          forces workarounds, and reduces user adoption.

        default: Critical configuration decisions include enabling optional features,
          setting validation thresholds, defining default values, and establishing
          workflow routing rules. Each decision affects system behavior and should
          be documented for future reference.
      automation_logic:

          or scheduled timing. Configure automation carefully to prevent infinite
          loops, ensure idempotent operations, and handle error conditions gracefully.
      performance_considerations:
        Point Of Sale Offline Mode: Limit offline transaction cache to 1000 orders
          to prevent browser performance degradation. Configure incremental sync instead
          of full sync for large product catalogs. Enable data compression for offline
          storage. Monitor IndexedDB size and implement cleanup policies. Optimize
          product image caching for offline availability. Test offline mode performance
          with realistic transaction volumes before deployment.
        Point Of Sale Hardware Setup: Use wired connections instead of Bluetooth when
          possible for reliability. Configure print job batching for high-volume periods.
          Enable direct printing instead of browser print dialog. Use dedicated POS
          terminals instead of general-purpose computers. Configure device timeouts
          appropriate for hardware response times. Implement hardware pooling for
          multiple POS stations sharing printers.
        Point Of Sale Receipt Customization: Minimize receipt template complexity
          to reduce rendering time. Optimize logo file size (recommended under 50KB).
          Use standard fonts instead of custom fonts when possible. Limit dynamic
          content requiring database lookups. Configure receipt preview caching for
          repeat transactions. Test receipt printing speed during peak transaction

          on checkout speed during peak hours.
        default: Monitor performance impact on system resources. Large-scale deployments
          may require infrastructure scaling, database optimization, or workflow adjustments
          to maintain acceptable response times.
      common_pitfall:
        Point Of Sale Offline Mode: Operating offline for extended periods (days)
          creates massive sync backlogs causing data conflicts and timeout failures.
          Set maximum offline duration of 8 hours before requiring reconnection and
          sync.
        Point Of Sale Hardware Setup: Not testing hardware failover scenarios causes
          checkout disruptions when printer jams or payment terminal fails. Configure
          backup devices and train staff on manual fallback procedures.
        Point Of Sale Receipt Customization: Adding too much information to receipts
          creates long receipts wasting paper and annoying customers. Keep receipts
          concise showing only essential transaction details and legal requirements.
        Point Of Sale Loyalty: Changing point earning ratios retroactively creates
          customer dissatisfaction and loyalty program distrust. Grandfather existing
          members under old rules when changing program terms.
        default: The most common configuration mistake is incomplete prerequisite
          setup. Verify all dependent modules are installed, company settings are
          configured, and user permissions are assigned before attempting configuration.
          Skipping prerequisites causes cryptic error messages that are difficult
          to diagnose.
      troubleshooting_tips:
        Point Of Sale Offline Mode: If synchronization fails repeatedly, check browser
          IndexedDB limits not exceeded, verify server API endpoints responding, confirm
          user permissions for data sync, and review conflict resolution logs for
          transaction duplicates.
        Point Of Sale Hardware Setup: If devices not detected, verify USB cables connected
          properly, check device drivers installed and updated, confirm IoT Box network
          connectivity, test device independently outside Odoo, and review browser
          hardware access permissions.
        Point Of Sale Receipt Customization: If receipts print incorrectly, verify
          printer paper width matches template configuration, check logo dimensions
          within printer memory limits, confirm font encoding supports special characters,
          test receipt preview before printing, and validate printer firmware version
          compatibility.
        Point Of Sale Loyalty: If points not calculating correctly, verify loyalty
          program active dates include current date, check customer assigned to correct
          loyalty program, confirm product eligible for point earning, review point
          calculation formula configuration, and test with manual point calculation
          to isolate issue.
        default: 'If configuration does not behave as expected: (1) Check server logs
          for error messages, (2) Verify user has required permissions, (3) Confirm
          prerequisite modules are installed, (4) Test in developer mode to see detailed
          error information, (5) Review recent configuration changes that might have
          introduced the issue.'
      validation_checklist:
        Point Of Sale Offline Mode: Simulate network failure during active POS session,
          verify transactions save locally, restore network and confirm automatic
          synchronization, test conflict resolution with duplicate orders, validate
          inventory accuracy post-sync, and verify no data loss during offline period
        Point Of Sale Hardware Setup: Test receipt printing with various transaction
          types, scan barcodes to verify product lookup, verify cash drawer opens
          on sale completion, process test card payment through terminal, confirm
          customer display shows correct information, and test all devices simultaneously
          under load
        Point Of Sale Receipt Customization: Print test receipts on actual thermal
          printer, verify logo displays correctly at correct size, confirm all legal
          information present and legible, test receipt with long product names, validate
          tax breakdown accuracy, check promotional messages display correctly, and
          verify receipt barcode scans properly for returns
        Point Of Sale Loyalty: Complete transaction with loyalty customer, verify
          points calculated correctly, test point redemption at checkout, confirm
          tier upgrade triggers properly, validate point expiration logic, test loyalty
          card barcode scanning, verify email notifications sent correctly, and confirm
          accounting entries for loyalty liability
        default: 'Before deploying configuration to production: (1) Test with sample
          data in development environment, (2) Verify user permissions grant appropriate
          access, (3) Confirm integration with related modules works correctly, (4)
          Document configuration decisions and expected behavior, (5) Create database
          backup, (6) Train users on new functionality, (7) Monitor system behavior

    template: 'Configuring {feature_name} in Odoo {odoo_version} requires understanding
      how production orders execute, how materials flow through work centers, and
      how costing calculations aggregate before committing BOM structures that affect
      every manufactured product in your catalog. Incorrect {feature_name} configuration
      creates material shortages, inaccurate production costs, and shop floor confusion
      that compounds across hundreds of manufacturing orders—planners develop manual
      workarounds that persist even after you fix the underlying configuration.


      Manufacturing configuration in Odoo differs fundamentally from other modules
      because changes to BOM structures, routing operations, or costing methods retroactively
      affect existing production orders and work-in-progress inventory valuations.
      A seemingly minor change to a phantom BOM can cascade through your entire product
      hierarchy, changing material requirements for finished goods three levels up
      in your product structure.


      {feature_specific_intro}


      ## {feature_name} Configuration Workflow


      {feature_setup_workflow}


      ### Prerequisites and Module Dependencies


      {feature_name} requires the Manufacturing (MRP) module and related dependencies
      installed before accessing configuration screens:


      {prerequisite_configuration}


      Navigate to Apps, search for "Manufacturing" and "Inventory", click Install.
      Odoo automatically configures basic manufacturing workflows, but {feature_name}
      requires additional setup beyond default installation.


      ## Core BOM and Production Settings


      {core_settings_section}


      ### BOM Structure and Computation Logic


      {bom_computation_logic}


      BOM consumption calculations execute at production order confirmation, not at
      order creation. Changes to BOM components after production order creation don''t
      affect already-confirmed orders. Test BOM structure changes in development environment
      with representative product hierarchies before deploying to production.


      ### Work Center and Routing Configuration


      {routing_configuration}


      Work center capacity constraints apply at work order scheduling, preventing
      overallocation when multiple production orders compete for limited resources.
      Configure realistic capacity limits based on actual equipment throughput, not
      theoretical maximum capacity.


      ## Production Planning and Scheduling


      {production_planning}


      ### Automation and MRP Triggers


      {automation_configuration}


      Automated procurement follows MRP logic: reordering rules trigger based on forecasted
      demand minus on-hand inventory minus in-transit purchases plus reserved quantities.
      Misconfigured rules create either excess inventory or stockouts, both expensive
      outcomes.


      ## Advanced Manufacturing Options


      {advanced_options}


      ### Integration with Inventory and Purchasing


      {integration_points}


      Manufacturing orders automatically create inventory moves when confirmed, reserve
      components when scheduled, and consume materials when work orders complete.
      Inventory valuation methods (FIFO, AVCO) affect production cost calculations—changing
      valuation methods mid-year creates accounting nightmares.


      ## Costing and Valuation Configuration


      {costing_configuration}


      Product costing in manufacturing aggregates component costs, work center labor/overhead
      rates, and by-product/scrap valuations. Real-time costing updates as production
      progresses, but many companies prefer standard costing with periodic variance
      analysis to avoid constant inventory revaluations.


      ## User Access and Permission Configuration


      {feature_name} permissions follow Odoo''s role-based access control model. Navigate
      to Settings > Users & Companies > Groups to configure manufacturing access levels:


      {permission_matrix}


      Manufacturing permissions cascade through production order lifecycle: users
      who can create production orders cannot necessarily confirm them, users who
      can confirm orders cannot necessarily mark work orders done. Design permission
      structure matching your shop floor approval workflow.


      ## Performance Optimization and Best Practices


      {performance_optimization}


      ### Reporting and Analytics Configuration


      Configure {feature_name} reporting to track production efficiency, material
      consumption variance, and manufacturing cost accuracy:


      {reporting_configuration}


      Production reports should mirror shop floor tracking systems. If your manufacturing
      manager tracks efficiency by work center utilization, configure Odoo reports
      identically rather than forcing stakeholders to learn new KPI definitions.


      ## Common Configuration Mistakes and Solutions


      {common_mistakes}


      ### Testing and Validation Checklist


      Before declaring {feature_name} configuration complete, validate these manufacturing
      scenarios with production-scale complexity:


      {validation_checklist}


      Configuration that works for simple products (5 components, 2 operations) often
      breaks with complex assemblies (50+ components, 10+ operations, nested sub-assemblies)
      due to BOM explosion timeouts, routing calculation errors, or capacity scheduling
      failures.

    variable_mappings:
      feature_specific_intro:
        Manufacturing Bom: 'Bill of Materials (BOM) configuration defines the recipe
          for transforming raw materials into finished products, specifying exact
          component quantities, consumption timing, and production sequencing. Incorrect
          BOM configuration causes material shortages mid-production when components
          aren''t available as expected, cost calculation errors that misstate product
          profitability, and shop floor confusion when assembly instructions don''t
          match actual component requirements.

          '
        Manufacturing Routing Operations: 'Routing configuration establishes the sequence
          of operations transforming components into finished products, defining work
          centers, operation durations, and resource requirements. Misconfigured routing
          creates unrealistic production schedules when operation times don''t reflect
          actual manufacturing capacity, work center bottlenecks when routing bypasses
          critical quality control steps, and inaccurate cost calculations when labor/overhead
          allocation doesn''t match actual production patterns.

          '
        Manufacturing Phantom Bom: 'Phantom BOM configuration defines intermediate
          assemblies that exist conceptually in product structure but never physically
          stock in inventory, enabling simplified production planning while maintaining
          detailed component tracking. Incorrect phantom BOM setup causes material
          requirement explosion errors when planning systems don''t properly cascade
          through phantom levels, inventory discrepancies when system expects phantom
          assemblies in stock, and production confusion when shop floor instructions
          reference non-existent intermediate products.

          '
        Manufacturing Flexible Bom: 'Flexible BOM configuration enables variant production
          where component substitutions adapt to material availability, customer specifications,
          or cost optimization without maintaining separate BOMs for every product
          variation. Incorrect flexible BOM setup causes production errors when invalid
          component substitutions create quality issues, cost variance when substitution
          logic doesn''t account for price differences, and inventory imbalances when
          substitute components aren''t properly reserved for production orders.

          '
        Manufacturing Capacity Planning: 'Capacity planning configuration establishes
          production constraints based on work center availability, labor resources,
          and equipment limitations, preventing over-scheduling and enabling realistic
          delivery commitments. Misconfigured capacity planning creates impossible
          production schedules when system ignores actual equipment throughput, shop
          floor chaos when multiple production orders compete for constrained resources,
          and missed customer delivery dates when scheduling algorithms don''t account
          for maintenance downtime or shift patterns.

          '
        Manufacturing Master Production Schedule: 'Master Production Schedule (MPS)
          configuration defines demand forecasts that drive material procurement and
          production planning, balancing customer orders against inventory targets
          and capacity constraints. Incorrect MPS configuration causes either excess
          inventory when forecasts exceed actual demand or stockouts when planning
          doesn''t anticipate demand spikes, procurement chaos when material requirements
          change daily as MPS fluctuates, and production inefficiency when shop floor
          constantly adjusts schedules chasing MPS changes.

          '
        Manufacturing Job Costing: 'Job costing configuration tracks actual production
          costs against estimated costs at individual manufacturing order level, enabling
          profitability analysis and cost variance identification. Misconfigured job
          costing creates inaccurate cost reporting when labor/overhead allocation
          methods don''t reflect actual resource consumption, profitability illusions
          when by-product credits aren''t properly applied, and variance analysis
          confusion when standard costs don''t periodically update to reflect current
          material prices.

          '
        default: This configuration feature plays a critical role in Odoo's operational
          functionality. Proper configuration ensures seamless integration with your
          business processes and delivers expected outcomes. Misconfiguration creates
          operational friction that compounds into permanent inefficiencies, forcing
          users to develop workarounds that persist even after the underlying issue
          is fixed. Configuration decisions made here affect all users and transactions
          across the system.

      core_settings_section:
        Manufacturing Bom: Access Manufacturing > Configuration > Settings. Enable
          'Multi-Level BoM' to support nested assemblies. Configure BoM versioning
          if tracking engineering changes. Set default consumption method (strict
          or flexible) for component usage. Enable 'BoM Cost' to display manufacturing
          cost breakdowns.
        Manufacturing Routing Operations: Navigate to Manufacturing > Configuration
          > Work Centers. For each work center, configure capacity (pieces/hour or
          concurrent operations), costs (labor + overhead rates), and working time
          calendars. Set time efficiency factor (typically 85-95% of theoretical maximum).
        Manufacturing Phantom Bom: In BOM configuration, select 'Kit' as BoM Type
          for phantom behavior. Enable 'Phantom' on intermediate product's Inventory
          tab. System treats phantom as pass-through during material requirement planning,
          bypassing intermediate product creation.
        Manufacturing Flexible Bom: Create product variants via Attributes & Values
          under product template. In BoM lines, use 'Apply on Variants' field to conditionally
          include components based on variant attributes. System dynamically generates
          BoM for specific variant at production order creation.
        Manufacturing Capacity Planning: Configure work center capacity as either
          'Pieces per hour' (for discrete manufacturing) or 'Concurrent Operations'
          (for continuous/batch). Set realistic time efficiency accounting for changeovers,
          breaks, unplanned downtime. Enable 'Finite Capacity' to prevent overloading.
        Manufacturing Master Production Schedule: Define forecast buckets (weekly/monthly)
          matching sales planning cycle. Set safety stock targets based on demand
          variability and lead time. Configure procurement method (make-to-stock vs.
          make-to-order) affecting when manufacturing orders generate.
        Manufacturing Job Costing: 'Enable real-time costing in Inventory > Configuration
          > Settings. For each work center, set hourly labor and overhead rates. Choose
          costing method: average cost (simple, smooths fluctuations) or real price
          (accurate, volatile based on actual costs).'
        default: Configuration options are accessible through the module's Configuration
          menu. Key settings include enabling/disabling feature flags, defining default
          values, establishing validation rules, and customizing behavior to match
          your business requirements. Configuration changes typically apply at company
          level unless explicitly scoped to user groups or specific records. Review
          each setting carefully as changes affect system-wide behavior.
      bom_computation_logic:
        Manufacturing Bom: 'BoM consumption calculates material requirements recursively
          through nested assemblies. Top-level BoM explodes to show all leaf-level
          components with multiplied quantities. Component consumption timing controls
          reservation: ''When order confirmed'' reserves immediately, ''When component
          used'' reserves at work order start.'
        Manufacturing Routing Operations: Routing operations execute sequentially
          unless marked as parallel. Total manufacturing lead time sums setup times,
          per-unit operation times × quantity, and inter-operation transfer times.
          Work center capacity constraints may extend lead time beyond routing duration
          when work center overloaded.
        Manufacturing Phantom Bom: Phantom BoM explosion bypasses intermediate assembly
          level during MRP calculation. System directly reserves leaf components without
          creating intermediate product inventory moves. Phantom assemblies appear
          on production documentation for shop floor guidance but don't generate separate
          manufacturing orders.
        Manufacturing Flexible Bom: Flexible BoM evaluates variant conditions at manufacturing
          order creation, generating variant-specific component list. System checks
          'Apply on Variants' conditions matching order's product variant. Components
          without variant restrictions apply to all variants (common components).
        Manufacturing Capacity Planning: 'Capacity planning calculates available time
          per work center: working hours × time efficiency × (1 - downtime percentage).
          Scheduled load accumulates operation durations from all manufacturing orders.
          When scheduled load exceeds available capacity, planning either reschedules
          to future periods or raises capacity alert.'
        Manufacturing Master Production Schedule: 'MPS runs MRP calculation generating
          procurement proposals: manufacturing orders for make items, purchase orders
          for buy items. Calculation considers demand (sales orders + forecast), supply
          (on-hand + in-transit + planned), and parameters (safety stock, lead time).
          MRP re-plans daily or on-demand.'
        Manufacturing Job Costing: Job costing aggregates component costs (average
          or real), work center labor costs (hours × hourly rate), overhead costs
          (hours × overhead rate), and additional costs (subcontracting, external
          services). Real-time valuation updates product cost as manufacturing order
          progresses.
        default: Bill of Materials calculations determine component quantities, cost
          rollup, and production feasibility. Configure BOM computation rules to match
          your manufacturing processes and inventory management practices.
      routing_configuration:
        Manufacturing Routing Operations: Create routing defining operation sequence.
          Each operation specifies work center, default duration (setup time + per-unit
          run time), and worksheet (instructions). Operations can run sequentially
          (one after another) or parallel (simultaneously). Link routing to BoM—one
          routing per BoM. Work orders generate for each routing operation when manufacturing
          order confirmed.
        Manufacturing Bom: If routing enabled, specify at which operation each component
          consumed. Early consumption (Operation 1) reserves components at production
          start. Late consumption (Operation 5) allows flexibility if earlier operations
          yield rejects. Backflush consumption (When order done) consumes components
          automatically at completion without manual confirmation.
        Manufacturing Capacity Planning: Routing duration calculations feed capacity
          planning. Finite capacity planning checks work center availability before
          scheduling operations. If work center overloaded, scheduler either delays
          operation start (pushing delivery date) or raises capacity warning requiring
          manual intervention.
        Manufacturing Job Costing: Routing operations link to work centers defining
          labor and overhead rates. Actual work order duration × work center hourly
          rate calculates operation cost. Compare actual operation duration against
          routing standard to identify efficiency variances. Excessive overtime or
          low yields create cost overruns.
        default: Work center routing defines production sequences, timing estimates,
          and resource allocation. Configure routing paths to optimize production
          flow and provide accurate capacity planning.
      production_planning:
        Manufacturing Master Production Schedule: MPS dashboard shows forecasted demand,
          actual orders, projected inventory, and procurement proposals per period.
          Green indicators show sufficient inventory, yellow shows approaching minimum
          stock, red shows stockout risk. Approve procurement proposals converting
          to confirmed manufacturing/purchase orders. Re-run MPS after demand changes
          to update proposals.
        Manufacturing Capacity Planning: Capacity planning view displays work center
          load chart showing scheduled hours vs. available hours per period. Overloaded
          periods display red, underutilized periods display green. Drag operations
          between periods to manually reschedule. Configure automatic leveling rules
          to balance load across available capacity.
        Manufacturing Bom: 'Plan manufacturing orders from MPS, sales orders, or manual
          creation. Manufacturing order confirms BoM at order creation—subsequent
          BoM changes don''t affect existing orders. Schedule production considering
          component lead times: manufacturing order start date must allow sufficient
          time for component procurement before production begins.'
        default: Production scheduling integrates demand forecasts, available capacity,
          and material availability. Configure planning parameters to balance production
          efficiency with inventory costs and customer delivery requirements.
      automation_configuration:
        Manufacturing Master Production Schedule: Configure automated MRP scheduling
          (daily cron job or on-demand trigger). Set procurement proposal auto-approval
          for trusted products. Enable automatic manufacturing order confirmation
          when all components available. Configure exception alerts for stockouts,
          capacity overloads, or late deliveries.
        Manufacturing Routing Operations: Configure work order auto-start when prior
          operation completes. Enable automatic component backflushing at operation
          completion (reduces data entry but risks accuracy). Set automated quality
          checks at critical operations triggering inspection workflow before proceeding.
        Manufacturing Capacity Planning: Enable automatic rescheduling when capacity
          exceeded—system pushes operations to future periods maintaining delivery
          commitments. Configure alert emails when specific work centers approach
          capacity limits. Set automatic overtime calculations when demand requires
          extended hours.
        default: Automation is supported through scheduled actions, automated actions,
          and server actions. Configure automation triggers based on record creation,
          field changes, or time-based schedules. Automated processes reduce manual
          data entry, enforce business rules consistently, and ensure timely execution
          of recurring tasks.
      advanced_options:
        Manufacturing Bom: Configure BoM versioning for engineering change management.
          Enable BoM comparison showing differences between versions. Set effectivity
          dates controlling when BoM becomes active. Configure BoM approval workflows
          requiring engineering and procurement signoff before activation.
        Manufacturing Flexible Bom: Advanced flexible BoM supports conditional logic
          beyond simple variant matching. Configure component substitution hierarchies
          (preferred → acceptable → emergency alternatives). Enable make/buy decisions
          dynamically based on component availability or cost thresholds.
        Manufacturing Routing Operations: Configure parallel operations executing
          simultaneously on different work centers. Enable operation splitting processing
          large batches across multiple machines. Set operation overlap allowing next
          operation to start before prior operation completes (useful for continuous
          flow production).
        Manufacturing Job Costing: Enable variance analysis comparing actual costs
          against standard costs. Configure variance thresholds triggering management
          alerts (e.g., >10% cost overrun). Set up cost rollup for multi-level assemblies
          showing cost contribution by component and operation.
        default: Advanced configuration options provide fine-grained control over
          this feature behavior. These settings handle edge cases, enable optional
          features, and customize system responses to specific scenarios. Review advanced
          options carefully as they may introduce complexity that increases maintenance
          overhead.
      integration_points:
        Manufacturing Bom: BoM integrates with Inventory (component availability),
          Purchasing (procurement proposals), Sales (configure-to-order), and Accounting
          (cost valuation). Manufacturing order confirmation creates inventory reservations.
          Component availability issues block order confirmation until components
          procured.
        Manufacturing Routing Operations: Routing integrates with Quality (inspection
          points), Maintenance (preventive maintenance scheduling), Timesheets (labor
          tracking), and Planning (capacity scheduling). Work order completion triggers
          quality checks before allowing next operation or finished product receipt.
        Manufacturing Master Production Schedule: MPS integrates with Sales (customer
          orders), Forecasting (demand planning), Inventory (stock levels), and Purchasing
          (vendor lead times). MRP calculation considers all demand sources generating
          unified procurement plan. Changes to sales forecasts trigger MPS replanning.
        Manufacturing Job Costing: Job costing integrates with Accounting (general
          ledger posting), Inventory (valuation updates), Payroll (labor cost capture),
          and Sales (profitability analysis). Manufacturing order completion posts
          work-in-progress to finished goods inventory at calculated cost.
        default: Integration with multiple Odoo modules including sales, purchasing,
          inventory, and accounting. Configuration determines which integration points
          are active, how data synchronizes across modules, and what validation rules
          apply to integrated records.
      costing_configuration:
        Manufacturing Job Costing: 'Select costing method per product category: Standard
          costing (fixed cost updated periodically) provides stable pricing but requires
          variance analysis. Average costing (moving average of actual costs) reflects
          current costs but creates price volatility. FIFO costing (first-in-first-out)
          matches costs to specific batches but adds complexity.'
        Manufacturing Bom: Component costing flows up through BoM hierarchy. Leaf
          components use purchase cost or prior manufacturing cost. Each assembly
          level adds component costs plus operation costs. Verify cost rollup calculations
          periodically as component prices and labor rates change.
        default: Cost calculation methods determine how expenses are tracked and allocated.
          Configure costing approaches to match accounting requirements and provide
          accurate financial reporting.
      permission_matrix:
        Manufacturing Bom: Manufacturing / User can view BOMs and create manufacturing
          orders. Manufacturing / Manager can create/edit BOMs and approve engineering
          changes. Restrict BoM editing to engineering team preventing unauthorized
          modifications. Enable BOM revision tracking showing who changed what when.
        Manufacturing Routing Operations: Manufacturing / User can view work orders
          and record production. Manufacturing / Manager can create/modify routing
          operations and work centers. Shop floor supervisors need work order completion
          permission without routing modification access.
        Manufacturing Master Production Schedule: Manufacturing / Planner can run
          MRP and create procurement proposals. Manufacturing / Manager can approve
          proposals and adjust planning parameters. Restrict MPS modification to demand
          planners preventing unauthorized forecast changes.
        Manufacturing Job Costing: Manufacturing / User can view production costs.
          Manufacturing / Manager can modify work center rates and costing methods.
          Accounting / Manager can adjust cost variance accounts and valuation methods.
          Separate duties between operations (production tracking) and accounting
          (cost configuration).
        default: 'User access is controlled through Odoo''s role-based permission
          system. Configure user groups to grant appropriate access levels: view-only
          access for data consumers, creation/edit rights for operational users, and
          full configuration access for system administrators. Test permissions with
          non-administrative accounts to verify security model works correctly.'
      performance_optimization:
        Manufacturing Bom: Index product variants for fast BOM lookup. Cache BOM explosion
          calculations for frequently-produced products. Limit BOM nesting depth to
          7 levels maximum preventing explosion timeout. Archive obsolete BOMs keeping
          production history without cluttering active BOM selection.
        Manufacturing Routing Operations: Configure realistic work center capacity
          preventing scheduling gridlock. Batch similar work orders on same work center
          minimizing changeover time. Enable work order splitting for large quantities
          improving shop floor flexibility. Monitor work center utilization identifying
          bottlenecks for capacity investment.
        Manufacturing Master Production Schedule: Run MRP during off-peak hours (overnight)
          preventing performance impact. Configure planning horizon matching realistic
          procurement lead times (3-6 months). Exclude slow-moving products from MPS
          using manual procurement. Optimize reordering rule parameters minimizing
          unnecessary procurement proposals.
        Manufacturing Job Costing: Use standard costing for high-volume products reducing
          valuation calculations. Implement average costing for materials with stable
          prices. Reserve real-time costing for critical products requiring precise
          cost tracking. Periodically review and update standard costs preventing
          large variances.
        default: Optimize performance by configuring appropriate database indexes,
          limiting automated action frequency, and archiving old records that no longer
          require active processing. Monitor system performance after configuration
          changes to identify bottlenecks. Large-scale deployments may require infrastructure
          scaling.
      reporting_configuration:
        Manufacturing Bom: Generate BOM comparison reports showing component changes
          between versions. Create BOM cost analysis reports displaying cost contribution
          by component. Configure BOM where-used reports identifying which products
          use specific components. Enable BOM explosion reports for procurement planning.
        Manufacturing Routing Operations: 'Monitor work center efficiency: actual
          time vs. standard time. Track work center utilization percentage identifying
          underutilized equipment. Generate operation cost variance reports comparing
          estimated vs. actual costs. Create work order completion rate dashboards
          measuring shop floor productivity.'
        Manufacturing Master Production Schedule: Configure MPS exception reports
          highlighting stockout risks, excess inventory, or capacity violations. Create
          procurement proposal reports for buyer review. Generate forecast accuracy
          reports comparing planned vs. actual demand. Monitor safety stock adequacy
          based on demand variability.
        Manufacturing Job Costing: Generate manufacturing cost variance reports by
          product, order, or time period. Create labor efficiency reports comparing
          actual vs. standard hours. Configure material usage variance reports identifying
          consumption overruns. Monitor manufacturing overhead absorption rate ensuring
          accurate cost allocation.
        default: Data appears in standard Odoo reports and can be included in custom
          report definitions. Configure reporting parameters to control which records
          appear in reports, how data aggregates, and what filters users can apply.
          Export capabilities allow this feature data extraction for external analysis.
      common_mistakes:
        Manufacturing Bom: Failing to version BOMs before changes causes inability
          to reproduce historical production orders. Not testing BOM changes in development
          before production deployment creates shop floor chaos when component requirements
          don't match reality. Forgetting to update component lead times in BOM creates
          procurement delays.
        Manufacturing Routing Operations: Setting unrealistic operation times creates
          impossible production schedules shop floor cannot achieve. Forgetting setup
          time separate from per-unit time understates total duration for small batches.
          Not configuring parallel operations misses opportunities to reduce lead
          time through concurrent processing.
        Manufacturing Phantom Bom: Accidentally treating regular assemblies as phantoms
          causes inventory tracking errors. Not documenting phantom assemblies on
          shop floor instructions creates operator confusion. Using phantom BOMs when
          intermediate inventory tracking required loses visibility into assembly-level
          stock.
        Manufacturing Capacity Planning: Ignoring time efficiency factors (breaks,
          changeovers, downtime) creates optimistic schedules. Not accounting for
          shared resources (operators working multiple machines) causes capacity overestimation.
          Forgetting planned maintenance downtime creates last-minute scheduling disruptions.
        Manufacturing Master Production Schedule: Setting safety stock too high creates
          excess inventory carrying costs. Setting too low causes frequent stockouts.
          Not adjusting forecast based on seasonality creates either shortages or
          overstock. Running MRP too frequently creates planning nervousness—unnecessary
          order rescheduling.
        Manufacturing Job Costing: Mixing costing methods (standard vs. actual) across
          related products creates incomparable profitability analysis. Not updating
          standard costs periodically causes massive variances when actual costs drift.
          Forgetting to account for by-product credits overstates main product costs.
        default: Common configuration errors include enabling features without prerequisite
          modules, configuring in wrong order (company settings before user permissions),
          skipping testing phase with non-production data, and failing to document
          configuration decisions for future reference. These mistakes create issues
          that are difficult to diagnose and require time-consuming rollback procedures.
      validation_checklist:
        Manufacturing Bom: Create manufacturing order for complex product (10+ components),
          verify component reservation accurate, confirm BOM explosion shows all nested

    template: 'Configuring {feature_name} for Odoo {odoo_version} requires understanding
      how request flows execute, how server processes handle concurrent connections,
      and how system-level settings affect application performance before deploying
      configurations that process thousands of user requests hourly. Incorrect {feature_name}
      configuration creates production outages when traffic spikes exceed capacity
      limits, security vulnerabilities when web server rules expose internal services,
      and performance degradation that compounds across multiple infrastructure layers—operations
      teams develop emergency restart schedules around system limitations that persist
      even after you fix the underlying configuration.


      Infrastructure configuration in Odoo differs fundamentally from application-level
      configuration because changes to web server settings, process management parameters,
      or caching strategies affect all users simultaneously without individual user
      controls. A seemingly minor change to worker process limits can cascade through
      your entire deployment, causing request timeouts for users three continents
      away from your server location.


      {feature_specific_intro}


      ## {feature_name} Architecture and Design


      {feature_architecture}


      ### System Requirements and Dependencies


      {feature_name} requires specific system packages, kernel parameters, and network
      configurations before deployment:


      {prerequisite_configuration}


      Verify kernel settings, filesystem limits, and network stack parameters meet
      requirements before installing {feature_name}. Insufficient system resources
      cause cryptic failures that don''t clearly indicate whether the problem stems
      from memory limits, file descriptor exhaustion, or network connection tracking
      tables.


      ## Installation and Initial Setup


      {installation_workflow}


      ### Service Configuration and Management


      {service_configuration}


      Infrastructure services typically run as systemd units, requiring proper dependency
      ordering, restart policies, and resource limits. Configure service files before
      enabling automatic startup—incorrect dependency chains cause boot failures where
      services start before their prerequisites, creating race conditions that succeed
      on fast servers but fail on slower hardware.


      ## Core Configuration Settings


      {core_settings_section}


      ### Performance Tuning Parameters


      Performance parameters require tuning based on actual workload patterns, not
      theoretical maximums. Monitor production metrics for 1-2 weeks before adjusting
      settings—premature optimization based on assumed traffic patterns often degrades
      performance for actual usage patterns.


      Tune resource limits empirically: start with conservative values, monitor under
      production load, adjust upward until hitting performance targets. Common tuning
      areas include connection pool sizes (database, cache), worker process counts
      (application servers), and buffer sizes (web servers, proxies). Document baseline
      metrics before tuning and measure improvement after each change to validate
      optimization effectiveness.


      ### Security Hardening Configuration


      Infrastructure security requires defense-in-depth: web server hardening blocks
      common attacks, firewall rules limit network exposure, process isolation contains
      compromises. Single-layer security creates false confidence—assume every layer
      will eventually fail and configure accordingly.


      Disable unnecessary services and features. Run services with minimal privileges
      using dedicated service accounts. Enable security modules (SELinux, AppArmor)
      in enforcing mode. Configure firewall rules allowing only required traffic.
      Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse. Enable audit logging for security-relevant
      events. Regularly update software to patch vulnerabilities.


      ## Load Distribution and High Availability


      Distribute traffic across multiple backend servers to eliminate single points
      of failure and increase capacity. Configure health checks to automatically remove
      failed backends from rotation. Implement session persistence (sticky sessions)
      if application requires stateful connections, otherwise prefer stateless load
      distribution for simpler scaling.


      ### Session Management


      Session affinity (sticky sessions) complicates load balancing but simplifies
      application development. Odoo''s session handling assumes consistent server
      state—distributing a single user''s requests across multiple backends requires
      shared session storage, adding latency and complexity.


      Configure session storage strategy matching your architecture: cookie-based
      for small deployments, Redis-backed for multi-server deployments, database-backed
      for maximum reliability at performance cost. Set session timeout matching user
      activity patterns—too short forces frequent re-authentication, too long increases
      security risk from abandoned sessions.


      ## Caching and Performance Optimization


      Caching reduces database load and improves response times by storing frequently
      accessed data in fast memory storage. Implement caching at multiple layers:
      browser caching for static assets, CDN caching for geographic distribution,
      application caching for computed values, database query caching for expensive
      queries.


      Configure appropriate TTL (time to live) per data type: static assets (1 year),
      product catalog (1 hour), user preferences (24 hours), system configuration
      (5 minutes). Monitor cache hit rates—above 80% indicates effective caching,
      below 50% suggests cache warming or TTL tuning needed.


      ### Cache Invalidation Strategies


      Cache invalidation in multi-server deployments requires coordination. Invalidating
      cache on one server doesn''t automatically invalidate other servers'' caches—stale
      cache entries persist until timeout or manual purge, creating consistency problems
      where users see different data depending on which server handled their request.


      Implement cache invalidation via pub/sub messaging (Redis pub/sub, RabbitMQ)
      or cache versioning (append version number to cache keys, increment on update).
      Test invalidation under production load to ensure coordination overhead doesn''t
      exceed caching benefits.


      ## Monitoring and Observability


      Monitor infrastructure metrics continuously: CPU utilization, memory consumption,
      disk I/O, network throughput, connection counts, request rates, response times,
      error rates. Set up automated alerting for threshold violations: disk space
      < 10%, CPU > 90% sustained, error rate > 1%, response time p95 > 3 seconds.


      ### Log Aggregation and Analysis


      Centralized logging becomes essential in multi-server deployments where troubleshooting
      requires correlating requests across load balancers, application servers, and
      databases. Timestamp synchronization via NTP prevents log correlation failures
      where events appear in impossible order due to clock skew.


      Implement structured logging with consistent formats across services. Configure
      log rotation to prevent disk exhaustion. Set retention policies balancing investigation
      needs against storage costs: 7 days hot storage for active troubleshooting,
      30 days warm storage for trend analysis, 1 year cold storage for compliance.


      ### Alert Configuration and Incident Response


      Alert thresholds require tuning based on baseline metrics—alerting on CPU >
      80% generates false alarms if normal operations routinely hit 75%, while alerting
      on CPU > 95% misses performance degradation until users already experience slowness.


      Configure alert routing: informational alerts to email, warnings to chat channels,
      critical alerts to paging systems. Implement alert escalation for unacknowledged
      critical alerts. Document runbooks for common alerts explaining diagnosis steps
      and remediation procedures.


      ## Backup and Disaster Recovery


      High availability prevents downtime but doesn''t replace backups. HA systems
      replicate corruption and deletion across all nodes—accidentally dropping a database
      table propagates instantly to all replicas, requiring restore from backup that
      exists outside the HA cluster.


      Implement backup strategy matching recovery objectives: full backups weekly,
      incremental backups daily, continuous WAL archiving for point-in-time recovery.
      Store backups in geographically separate location from production. Test restore
      procedures quarterly—untested backups are theoretical backups, not actual disaster
      recovery capability.


      ## Integration with Odoo Application


      {feature_name} integrates with Odoo''s application layer through specific connection
      methods and communication protocols. Configure Odoo to operate behind infrastructure
      layer: set proxy_mode = True in odoo.conf for reverse proxy deployments, configure
      session storage for multi-server deployments, adjust worker limits matching
      infrastructure capacity.


      Test integration thoroughly with production-scale load before deployment. Configuration
      that works with 10 concurrent users often fails at 100 concurrent users due
      to connection pool exhaustion, memory pressure, or network bandwidth saturation.
      Load test with 2-3x expected peak traffic to validate capacity headroom.


      ## User Access and Permission Configuration


      Infrastructure services typically require root or sudo access for installation
      but should run as dedicated service accounts with minimal privileges. Running
      infrastructure services as root creates security risks—process compromise grants
      attacker full system access.


      Configure service accounts, file ownership, and SELinux/AppArmor policies before
      initial service start. Restrict SSH access to infrastructure servers: disable
      password authentication, require key-based authentication, limit access to specific
      IP ranges or VPN. Enable sudo logging to audit privileged operations. Rotate
      service credentials quarterly.


      ## Performance Optimization Best Practices


      Calculate optimal resource allocation empirically: start with recommended values,
      monitor under production load, adjust until achieving performance targets at
      acceptable cost. Common optimization areas include worker process counts (match
      CPU cores × 2), connection pool sizes (workers × 2), memory limits (total RAM
      / workers), timeout values (p95 response time + 50% buffer).


      ### Resource Limit Configuration


      Linux resource limits (ulimits) constrain individual processes, preventing resource
      exhaustion from affecting other services. Configure limits in both /etc/security/limits.conf
      (user-level) and systemd service files (service-level)—misconfigured limits
      in either location cause failures.


      Set file descriptor limits (nofile) ≥ 65535 for high-connection services (web
      servers, load balancers). Set process limits (nproc) ≥ 4096 for multi-process
      applications (Odoo workers). Configure kernel parameters (net.core.somaxconn,
      net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog) matching connection volume. Restart services after
      limit changes to apply new values.


      ## Common Configuration Mistakes and Solutions


      Common mistake: Under-provisioning connection pools, causing connection exhaustion
      under load. Solution: Set connection pool size = (worker_count × 2) + overhead,
      monitor pool utilization, increase if exceeding 80% usage. Mistake: Ignoring
      log rotation, causing disk exhaustion. Solution: Configure logrotate for all
      services, compress old logs, delete logs older than retention policy.


      Mistake: Not testing failover procedures, discovering configuration errors during
      actual outages. Solution: Schedule quarterly disaster recovery drills, document
      failures discovered, update procedures and automation. Mistake: Copying production
      data to development without sanitization, violating privacy regulations. Solution:
      Implement data anonymization scripts, validate anonymization effectiveness,
      restrict development environment access.


      ### Testing and Validation Checklist


      Before declaring {feature_name} configuration complete, validate these infrastructure
      scenarios with production-scale load:


      - Load test with 2x expected peak traffic, verify stable performance

      - Failover test: stop primary service, verify automatic recovery within SLA

      - Security scan with penetration testing tools, verify no critical vulnerabilities

      - Backup restore test: restore from backup to isolated environment, verify data
      integrity

      - Network partition test (for HA setups): simulate network split, verify cluster
      behavior

      - Resource exhaustion test: gradually increase load until hitting limits, verify
      graceful degradation

      - Configuration drift test: compare deployed configuration against version control,
      verify no unauthorized changes


      Infrastructure configuration that works in development (10 concurrent users,
      100 MB/s network, local storage) often breaks in production (1000 concurrent
      users, 10 Gb/s network, remote storage) due to connection pool exhaustion, network
      latency amplification, or filesystem locking contention. Always validate with
      production-scale load in staging environment before deploying to production.

          and request timeouts when limit too low aborts legitimate long-running operations—requiring

      feature_architecture:
        Nginx Configuration: 'Nginx''s event-driven asynchronous architecture handles
          thousands of concurrent connections with minimal memory overhead, using
          non-blocking I/O and worker processes matching CPU core count. Unlike Apache''s

          simultaneously through event loops, making it ideal for serving Odoo''s

          consuming M memory (preventing memory leaks), cron workers execute exclusively
          (one job at a time per worker), and LiveChat workers maintain persistent
          connections—requiring different scaling strategies per worker type.
