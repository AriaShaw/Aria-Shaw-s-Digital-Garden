      **Pro Tip**: Enable PostgreSQL's `pg_stat_statements` extension to identify slow queries in production. Run `CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_statements;` then query `pg_stat_statements` view weekly to find queries consuming excessive CPU time. Odoo's ORM sometimes generates inefficient SQL for complex filters—this extension reveals exactly which operations need optimization.

      **Pro Tip**: Change SSH's default port 22 to a high-numbered port (e.g., 47822) to eliminate 95% of automated bot attacks from server logs. Attackers script port 22 scans; custom ports require targeted reconnaissance. Update UFW firewall rules and SSH config simultaneously to avoid lockout.

      **Pro Tip**: Store backup encryption keys separately from backup storage. If attackers compromise your backup bucket, encrypted backups without accessible keys remain secure. Use AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault for key storage—never commit encryption keys to git repositories or store them on the same server as Odoo.

      **Pro Tip**: Run Odoo in development mode with `--dev=all` flag during custom module development. This enables auto-reload on code changes, detailed error stack traces, and disables asset bundling for easier JavaScript debugging. Never use dev mode in production—it disables security features and performance optimizations.

      **Pro Tip**: Export your source system's data in CSV format with UTF-8 encoding explicitly specified. Excel's default CSV export uses system locale encoding (often Windows-1252), causing data corruption for customer names with accented characters or currency symbols. Python's pandas library handles encoding conversion reliably: `pd.read_csv('export.csv', encoding='windows-1252').to_csv('utf8_export.csv', encoding='utf-8')`.

      **Pro Tip**: Cloud provider billing granularity creates optimization opportunities. AWS bills EC2 per-second after the first minute; Azure bills per-minute. Shutdown development/staging instances during non-business hours using scheduled scripts—an instance running 40 hours weekly instead of 168 hours reduces costs by 76% monthly.

      **Pro Tip**: Certbot's `--deploy-hook` parameter executes scripts after successful certificate renewal. Use this to reload NGINX automatically: `certbot renew --deploy-hook="systemctl reload nginx"`. Without hooks, renewed certificates don't take effect until manual NGINX reload, leaving old certificates active until expiration.

      **Pro Tip**: Configure Odoo's log level to WARNING in production, not DEBUG. Debug logging generates gigabytes of logs daily for active instances, filling disk space and obscuring actual errors in noise. Enable DEBUG temporarily during troubleshooting, then revert immediately after diagnosing issues.

      **Pro Tip**: Create role-specific video walkthroughs (2-3 minutes each) demonstrating common tasks in Odoo: sales reps creating quotations, warehouse staff processing pickings, accountants reconciling payments. Video documentation reduces support requests by 60% compared to written manuals—users watch once and reference later when stuck.

      **Pro Tip**: Odoo's XML-RPC API rate limits external integrations to prevent denial-of-service scenarios. Batch API calls using `execute_kw` with array parameters instead of individual requests per record. Creating 1000 products via 1000 separate calls takes 15 minutes; batching into 10 calls of 100 records completes in 90 seconds.
