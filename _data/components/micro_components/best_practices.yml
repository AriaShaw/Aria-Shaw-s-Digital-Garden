    category: documentation
    semantic_tags:
      - documentation
      - knowledge_management
      - maintenance
    priority: high
    content: |
      **Best Practice**: Document your Odoo infrastructure in a dedicated wiki or knowledge base—server IP addresses, SSH key locations, database credentials (encrypted), backup procedures, and disaster recovery steps. When emergency strikes at 2 AM or team members change roles, comprehensive documentation transforms panic into orderly response.

    category: environment_separation
    semantic_tags:
      - development
      - staging
      - production
    priority: critical
    content: |
      **Best Practice**: Maintain separate development, staging, and production environments with identical configurations. Test changes in development, validate in staging with production data clones, then deploy to production. This three-tier approach catches issues before they impact business operations and provides safe testing grounds for upgrades and customizations.

  - id: best_practice_003
    category: backup
    semantic_tags:
      - backup
      - offsite
      - redundancy
    priority: critical
    content: |
      **Best Practice**: Follow the 3-2-1 backup rule: maintain 3 copies of data (production + 2 backups), on 2 different storage types (local disk + cloud storage), with 1 copy offsite (different geographic region). This protects against hardware failure, datacenter disasters, and ransomware attacks simultaneously.

  - id: best_practice_004
    category: change_management
    semantic_tags:
      - change_management
      - deployment
      - rollback
    priority: high
    content: |
      **Best Practice**: Schedule configuration changes and module installations during maintenance windows announced to users 48 hours in advance. Document rollback procedures before making changes—if problems emerge, you need immediate reversal steps, not time-consuming troubleshooting under pressure.

  - id: best_practice_005
    category: security
    semantic_tags:
      - security
      - password_management
      - mfa
    priority: critical
    content: |
      **Best Practice**: Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all Odoo user accounts with administrative privileges. Password-only authentication provides single point of failure—compromised passwords grant full system access. Odoo supports TOTP-based MFA through the auth_totp module; enable it immediately for admin, manager, and accountant roles.

  - id: best_practice_006
    category: monitoring
    semantic_tags:
      - monitoring
      - alerting
      - health_checks
    priority: high
    content: |
      **Best Practice**: Implement health check endpoints that verify Odoo's critical dependencies—PostgreSQL connectivity, filestore accessibility, memory availability. Configure external monitoring (UptimeRobot, StatusCake) to query these endpoints every 5 minutes and alert via SMS/Slack when failures occur. Internal monitoring misses network-level outages that affect user access.

  - id: best_practice_007
    category: performance
    semantic_tags:
      - performance
      - capacity_planning
      - scalability
    priority: medium
    content: |
      **Best Practice**: Track performance metrics weekly—average response time, 95th percentile latency, database query counts, memory usage patterns. Establish baselines during normal operations, then monitor for deviations that indicate performance degradation before users complain. Proactive performance management prevents emergency scaling during critical business periods.

  - id: best_practice_008
    category: module_management
    semantic_tags:
      - modules
      - customization
      - maintainability
    priority: high
    content: |
      **Best Practice**: Create custom modules for business-specific customizations instead of modifying Odoo's core code or third-party modules directly. Custom modules isolate your changes from upstream updates, enabling clean Odoo version upgrades without merge conflicts. Name custom modules with company prefix (e.g., `acme_custom_sales`) for clear distinction from standard Odoo modules.

  - id: best_practice_009
    category: user_training
    semantic_tags:
      - training
      - documentation
      - adoption
    priority: medium
    content: |
      **Best Practice**: Conduct role-based Odoo training before go-live, not after. Train sales teams on opportunity management and quotation creation, warehouse staff on picking and packing operations, accountants on invoice reconciliation and reporting. Post-deployment training means users struggle independently, creating frustration and resistance to adoption.

  - id: best_practice_010
    category: testing
    semantic_tags:
      - testing
      - quality_assurance
      - validation
    priority: high
    content: |
      **Best Practice**: Create test scripts covering critical business workflows—complete sales cycle from quotation to invoice to payment, purchase orders through goods receipt to vendor payment, manufacturing orders from raw materials to finished goods. Execute these scripts after every Odoo upgrade or module installation to verify functionality remains intact.

  - id: best_practice_011
    category: database
    semantic_tags:
      - database
      - maintenance
      - optimization
    priority: medium
    content: |
      **Best Practice**: Schedule monthly database maintenance during low-usage windows: VACUUM ANALYZE to reclaim space, REINDEX to rebuild fragmented indexes, and UPDATE pg_stat_statements to reset query statistics. Regular maintenance prevents gradual performance degradation that accumulates over months of heavy transaction volumes.

  - id: best_practice_012
    category: incident_response
    semantic_tags:
      - incident_response
      - disaster_recovery
      - communication
    priority: high
    content: |
      **Best Practice**: Document incident response procedures explicitly—who receives security alerts, what actions responders take immediately, when to escalate to leadership, and how to communicate with users during outages. Practice these procedures through tabletop exercises quarterly to ensure team familiarity when real incidents occur.
