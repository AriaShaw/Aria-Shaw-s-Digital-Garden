  - id: callout_security_001
    type: security_warning
    semantic_tags:
      - security
      - warning
      - best_practice
    tone: authoritative
    content: |
      **Security Warning**: Never expose Odoo's port 8069 directly to the internet without NGINX reverse proxy protection. Direct exposure bypasses SSL/TLS encryption, rate limiting, and request filtering—attackers can access administrative interfaces and attempt brute-force attacks on database credentials without obstruction.

  - id: callout_performance_001
    type: performance_tip
    semantic_tags:
      - performance
      - optimization
      - database
    tone: technical
    content: |
      **Performance Impact**: PostgreSQL's default `shared_buffers` setting (128MB) leaves 90% of available RAM unused. Odoo performs thousands of database queries daily—increasing `shared_buffers` to 25% of system RAM dramatically improves query response times for inventory searches, report generation, and bulk operations.

  - id: callout_backup_001
    type: critical_warning
    semantic_tags:
      - backup
      - disaster_recovery
      - data_loss
    tone: urgent
    content: |
      **Critical**: Untested backups provide false security. Schedule a disaster recovery drill within your first week—restore yesterday's backup to a test instance and verify all data loads correctly, modules function properly, and custom configurations persist. You only discover backup corruption or missing steps when disaster strikes and recovery fails.

  - id: callout_cost_001
    type: cost_optimization
    semantic_tags:
      - cost
      - optimization
      - cloud
    tone: advisory
    content: |
      **Cost Optimization**: Cloud providers charge for idle resources identically to active ones. Right-size your instance based on actual usage patterns after the first month. An oversized instance running at 30% CPU utilization wastes 40-50% of infrastructure budget annually—downsize and reallocate those savings to backup storage or monitoring tools.

  - id: callout_migration_001
    type: data_warning
    semantic_tags:
      - migration
      - data_integrity
      - validation
    tone: cautionary
    content: |
      **Data Integrity Check**: Source system exports often contain years of accumulated inconsistencies—duplicate customer records, products without categories, transactions referencing deleted accounts. Cleaning data before import costs days; fixing after import costs weeks. Run validation queries on exports before transformation: check for null required fields, orphaned foreign keys, and duplicate identifiers.

  - id: callout_ssl_001
    type: configuration_warning
    semantic_tags:
      - ssl
      - https
      - security
    tone: technical
    content: |
      **SSL Configuration**: Let's Encrypt certificates expire after 90 days, but automated renewal via cron jobs can fail silently due to DNS propagation issues, firewall changes, or disk space exhaustion. Set up monitoring that alerts 15 days before expiration—this provides sufficient time to diagnose renewal failures and manually intervene before users encounter certificate warnings.

  - id: callout_upgrade_001
    type: version_warning
    semantic_tags:
      - upgrade
      - compatibility
      - testing
    tone: cautionary
    content: |
      **Version Compatibility**: Major Odoo version upgrades (14→15, 15→16) break custom modules and third-party addons due to API changes and removed features. Test upgrades in staging environments with full data sets—not just sample data—to expose compatibility issues before they impact production. Budget 2-3 hours per custom module for code updates and testing.

  - id: callout_user_access_001
    type: security_best_practice
    semantic_tags:
      - security
      - access_control
      - user_management
    tone: authoritative
    content: |
      **Access Control Best Practice**: Don't use the default 'admin' user for daily operations. Create personal accounts with limited privileges for routine tasks and reserve 'admin' for system configuration and module installation. This separation prevents accidental configuration changes and provides clear audit trails for compliance requirements.

  - id: callout_database_001
    type: maintenance_warning
    semantic_tags:
      - database
      - maintenance
      - performance
    tone: technical
    content: |
      **Database Maintenance**: PostgreSQL's autovacuum process reclaims storage from deleted records, but heavy transaction volumes can outpace automatic cleanup. Schedule weekly manual VACUUM ANALYZE operations during low-usage windows to prevent index bloat that degrades query performance by 30-50% over time.

  - id: callout_monitoring_001
    type: operational_tip
    semantic_tags:
      - monitoring
      - alerting
      - proactive
    tone: advisory
    content: |
      **Proactive Monitoring**: Configure alerts at 80% thresholds—80% CPU, 80% memory, 80% disk space—not 90% or 95%. The 80% trigger provides early warning with time for planned interventions. By 90%, you're firefighting during business hours instead of scheduling maintenance windows.
