    primary_appeal: "independence"
    text: "Digital sovereignty means controlling your business data and infrastructure without dependency on vendors who restrict access, limit customization, or increase prices arbitrarily because they hold your operational capability hostage. {{ metadata.title }} on {{ provider_name }} delivers that sovereignty by giving you root-level access to virtual machines running your complete Odoo stack."

    text: "{{ provider_name }}'s {{ recommended_instance.instance_type }} instance delivers the compute and memory resources that {{ odoo_version.name }} requires for production deployments serving {{ recommended_instance.recommended_for }}. The {{ recommended_instance.vcpus }} dedicated vCPUs handle concurrent user requests without CPU steal, while {{ recommended_instance.ram_gb }}GB RAM provides sufficient headroom for PostgreSQL query caching."

    text: "Migrating business operations from QuickBooks, Excel spreadsheets, NetSuite, or legacy ERP systems to Odoo requires production infrastructure ready before you begin data migration activities. Attempting to set up servers while simultaneously mapping data fields, validating import procedures, and training users guarantees timeline delays and increases the risk of errors that corrupt production data."

    word_count: 45
    primary_pain_point: "configuration_drift"
    text: "Odoo deployments fail most often from accumulated small configuration errors rather than single catastrophic mistakes. Installing PostgreSQL without tuning shared_buffers creates memory pressure. Configuring NGINX without extended timeouts causes request failures. Running Odoo without proper systemd management means manual restarts after updates. Each individual mistake seems minor until they compound into production instability."

    primary_pain_point: "vendor_dependency"
    text: "Managed Odoo providers restrict customization, charge premium rates for additional storage or compute resources, and create vendor lock-in through proprietary backup formats and limited data export options. When you deploy on infrastructure you control, you eliminate these restrictions while gaining operational knowledge that survives vendor changes and protects against arbitrary price increases."

    text: "The technical foundation you establish today determines whether your Odoo system scales smoothly from ten users to one hundred, or requires disruptive infrastructure rebuilds when you hit performance ceilings. Configuration decisions during deployment—PostgreSQL tuning, worker process calculations, NGINX timeout settings—either provide growth headroom or create bottlenecks that demand expensive remediation later."
