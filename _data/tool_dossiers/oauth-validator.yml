problem_statement: OAuth integrations break unexpectedly in production when tokens
  expire, scopes change, or authorization flows fail. Debugging OAuth issues requires
  manual API calls, base64 encoding, and complex HTTP request crafting. Without proper
  testing, authentication failures only surface when users can't access integrated
  systems.
value_proposition: A free OAuth 2.0 validator that automates authorization flow
  testing, token refresh validation, and scope verification - helping you catch authentication
  issues before deployment without expensive API testing platforms.
how_to_use:
- step: Generate authorization URL
  command: python3 oauth_validator.py --client-id YOUR_ID --client-secret YOUR_SECRET
    --auth-url https://provider.com/oauth/authorize --token-url https://provider.com/oauth/token
    --scope "read write"
- step: Exchange authorization code for token
  command: python3 oauth_validator.py --client-id YOUR_ID --client-secret YOUR_SECRET
    --auth-url https://provider.com/oauth/authorize --token-url https://provider.com/oauth/token
    --code AUTHORIZATION_CODE
- step: Test token refresh
  command: python3 oauth_validator.py --client-id YOUR_ID --client-secret YOUR_SECRET
    --token-url https://provider.com/oauth/token --refresh-token YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN
- step: Validate access token against API
  command: python3 oauth_validator.py --client-id YOUR_ID --client-secret YOUR_SECRET
    --token-url https://provider.com/oauth/token --code AUTH_CODE --api-endpoint
    https://api.provider.com/user
how_it_works: This Python script implements the OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow.
  It generates authorization URLs with proper parameters (client_id, redirect_uri,
  scope, state), exchanges authorization codes for access/refresh tokens via POST
  requests, validates token responses for required fields, tests refresh token functionality,
  and validates access tokens by calling protected API endpoints with Bearer authentication.
  Includes expiration checking with warnings for tokens expiring within 5 minutes.
  No token storage or automatic refresh - designed for manual testing and debugging
  OAuth integrations during development.
real_world_use_cases:
- scenario: Salesforce to Odoo CRM integration
  outcome: Discovered OAuth scope mismatch before production (requested 'api' scope
    but needed 'api refresh_token offline_access'). Testing revealed missing refresh_token
    in response, preventing 24-hour token expiration failures that would have disrupted
    lead synchronization.
- scenario: Google Workspace integration for Odoo email
  outcome: Identified token refresh endpoint returning 400 errors due to incorrect
    grant_type parameter. Fixed before deployment, avoiding authentication failures
    that would have prevented 500 users from sending emails through Odoo.
troubleshooting_faq:
- question: How do I handle OAuth providers with different token response formats?
  answer: The script validates standard OAuth 2.0 token responses (access_token,
    token_type, expires_in). Some providers add custom fields or use different field
    names. Check the response JSON and modify the script accordingly. The Master
    Pack includes provider-specific validators for 50+ OAuth providers with automatic
    response parsing.
- question: My authorization URL requires PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange). Is
    that supported?
  answer: This free script implements basic authorization code flow without PKCE.
    For PKCE support, you need to generate code_verifier and code_challenge parameters.
    The Master Pack includes PKCE validator with S256 and plain challenge methods
    for enhanced security testing.
- question: How can I test OAuth with localhost redirect URIs?
  answer: The script defaults to http://localhost:8080/callback. Many providers require
    HTTPS even for localhost. Consider using ngrok for HTTPS tunneling or configure
    provider to allow HTTP localhost. The Master Pack includes built-in local callback
    server that captures authorization codes automatically without manual copy-paste.
- question: Can this tool detect insufficient OAuth scopes before API calls fail?
  answer: The script validates scopes returned in token response against requested
    scopes. However, scope enforcement happens at API level. To test scope permissions,
    use --api-endpoint flag with various API calls. The Master Pack includes comprehensive
    scope testing with 100+ pre-defined API endpoint tests per provider.
