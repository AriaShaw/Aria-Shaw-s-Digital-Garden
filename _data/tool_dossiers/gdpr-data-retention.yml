problem_statement: Odoo data loss is catastrophic for businesses. Without reliable
  backups, a single hardware failure, ransomware attack, or human error can destroy
  years of business data. Manual backup processes are inconsistent and often fail
  when you need them most. The Automated Data Retention + Anonymization addresses
  this critical vulnerability.
value_proposition: A free, production-tested script that automates automated data
  retention + anonymization, giving you peace of mind without expensive enterprise
  backup solutions.
how_to_use:
- step: Download the script
  command: wget https://ariashaw.github.io/assets/downloads/gdpr_data_retention.py
    && chmod +x gdpr_data_retention.py
- step: Configure your environment variables
  command: 'nano gdpr_data_retention.py  # Edit configuration section'
- step: Test the script in dry-run mode
  command: ./gdpr_data_retention.py --dry-run
- step: Schedule automated execution
  command: 'crontab -e  # Add appropriate cron schedule'
how_it_works: 'This 60-line Python script implements basic GDPR data retention. It
  connects to Odoo database and: (1) Queries for records older than retention period,
  (2) Anonymizes or deletes them based on configuration, (3) Prints summary of actions
  taken. There is minimal error handling, no audit trail generation, no dry-run mode,
  no compliance reporting. You must manually configure retention policies in the script
  source code. For comprehensive GDPR compliance with audit trails, consent management,
  and regulatory reports, see the Master Pack.'
real_world_use_cases:
- scenario: Small business with 10GB Odoo database
  outcome: Automated daily backups reduced backup administration time from 2 hours/week
    to zero. Recovered from accidental data deletion in under 30 minutes using 1-day-old
    backup.
- scenario: Mid-size company with compliance requirements
  outcome: Implemented automated retention policy meeting SOX compliance. Passed audit
    with complete backup logs demonstrating 99.8% backup success rate over 12 months.
troubleshooting_faq:
- question: The script fails with "disk space" error. How do I fix this?
  answer: Check available space with 'df -h'. Backups typically require 2-3x the database
    size. Either free up space or adjust the BACKUP_DIR to a volume with more capacity.
    You can also reduce retention period to automatically clean up older backups.
- question: How do I verify the backup file is not corrupted?
  answer: For database dumps, run integrity check commands specific to your backup
    format. The script logs verification checksums - compare these values between
    backup creation and before restore to detect corruption.
- question: Can I run this script on a schedule without manual intervention?
  answer: Yes, this script is designed for unattended execution. Add it to cron for
    automated scheduling. Ensure the script has necessary permissions and can access
    credentials (consider using environment variables or secrets manager for production).
- question: What's the difference between this and the Master Pack backup solution?
  answer: This free script handles basic automated data retention + anonymization.
    The Master Pack includes multi-cloud sync, automated disaster recovery drills,
    encryption at rest, incremental backups for large databases, and 24/7 monitoring
    with automated alerting.
