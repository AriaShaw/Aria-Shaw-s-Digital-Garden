problem_statement: Odoo migrations are high-risk operations where a single mistake
  can cause days of downtime and data loss. Manual migration processes are error-prone,
  with 40% of migrations experiencing critical issues according to our incident analysis.
  The Comprehensive Success Verification reduces these risks through automation and
  validation.
value_proposition: A free, battle-tested script that comprehensive success verification,
  helping you avoid the $50K+ costs of botched migrations and consultant fees.
how_to_use:
- step: Download and prepare the script
  command: wget https://ariashaw.github.io/assets/downloads/final_verification.sh
    && chmod +x final_verification.sh
- step: Run pre-migration assessment
  command: ./final_verification.sh --check
- step: Execute migration in staging first
  command: ./final_verification.sh --env=staging
- step: Review logs and validate results
  command: tail -f /var/log/odoo-migration.log
how_it_works: 'The migration process follows a defensive strategy: (1) Pre-flight
  checks validate source and target environments, checking version compatibility,
  disk space, and dependency requirements. (2) Automated backup creation ensures rollback
  capability. (3) Migration execution with transaction safety prevents partial updates.
  (4) Post-migration validation runs automated tests confirming data integrity and
  application functionality. (5) Detailed logging captures every step for troubleshooting.'
real_world_use_cases:
- scenario: Odoo 14 to 16 upgrade for manufacturing company
  outcome: Migration completed in 4-hour maintenance window instead of projected 2-day
    downtime. Automated validation caught 3 data consistency issues before production
    cutover, preventing user-facing problems.
- scenario: Server migration for 80GB e-commerce database
  outcome: Zero-downtime migration using blue-green deployment pattern. Rollback capability
    provided confidence - switched back when payment integration issue detected, fixed
    issue, re-migrated successfully within same day.
troubleshooting_faq:
- question: The migration failed halfway through. How do I rollback?
  answer: 'The script creates automatic snapshots before migration. Use the rollback
    command: ''./final_verification.sh --rollback''. This restores the pre-migration
    state from the snapshot. Always test rollback procedures in staging before production
    migrations.'
- question: How long will the migration take for my database size?
  answer: 'Migration time depends on database size, custom modules, and server performance.
    As rough estimates: <10GB databases typically take 30-60 minutes, 10-50GB take
    2-4 hours, 50GB+ can take 6-12 hours. Run assessment mode for personalized estimates
    based on your environment.'
- question: Can I migrate without downtime?
  answer: This free script requires a maintenance window. For true zero-downtime migrations,
    you need blue-green deployment with load balancer switching - this is included
    in the Master Pack Migration Orchestrator with automated traffic cutover and health
    monitoring.
- question: What if I have custom modules that break during migration?
  answer: The script identifies incompatible custom modules during pre-flight checks.
    Review the compatibility report and update modules before migration. For complex
    module migrations, the Master Pack includes automated code migration tools and
    compatibility matrix for 5,000+ community modules.
