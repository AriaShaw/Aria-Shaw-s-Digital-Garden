problem_statement: Production issues that go undetected for hours can cost thousands
  in lost revenue and damage customer trust. Without proactive monitoring, you only
  discover problems when users complain. The Odoo Health Monitoring Script provides
  early warning of issues before they impact your business.
value_proposition: A free monitoring script that continuous health monitoring with
  alerting for memory, disk, database connections, and worker availability, helping
  you maintain 99.9% uptime without expensive enterprise monitoring solutions.
how_to_use:
- step: Download and install
  command: wget https://ariashaw.com/assets/downloads/advanced_monitor_odoo.sh
    && chmod +x advanced_monitor_odoo.sh
- step: Configure thresholds and alerts
  command: 'nano advanced_monitor_odoo.sh  # Set CPU, memory, disk thresholds'
- step: Run initial health check
  command: ./advanced_monitor_odoo.sh --check-now
- step: Schedule continuous monitoring
  command: 'crontab -e  # Add: */5 * * * * /path/to/advanced_monitor_odoo.sh'
how_it_works: 'The monitoring system uses multi-layered health checks: (1) System
  metrics (CPU, memory, disk) are sampled and compared against thresholds. (2) Service
  availability is tested through process checks and port scanning. (3) Application-level
  health is verified through database connectivity and response time tests. (4) Anomaly
  detection identifies unusual patterns even within normal thresholds. (5) Alerts
  are generated when issues are detected, with severity levels based on impact. (6)
  All metrics are logged for historical analysis.'
real_world_use_cases:
- scenario: E-commerce site with seasonal traffic spikes
  outcome: Detected memory leak 3 hours before it would have caused outage during
    Black Friday sale. Proactive restart prevented revenue loss estimated at $45,000.
- scenario: Multi-tenant SaaS provider with 50 clients
  outcome: Automated monitoring caught disk space exhaustion at 85% instead of 100%,
    allowing graceful cleanup before service degradation. Reduced MTTR (Mean Time
    To Resolution) from 2 hours to 15 minutes with automated alerts.
troubleshooting_faq:
- question: I'm getting false positive alerts. How do I reduce noise?
  answer: Adjust threshold values in the configuration section to match your normal
    operating ranges. Consider using percentage-based thresholds instead of absolute
    values. Enable alert suppression during known maintenance windows. The script
    supports threshold tuning - start conservative and relax thresholds based on observed
    baselines.
- question: How do I get alerts via email or Slack instead of just logs?
  answer: This free script logs to files by default. For email alerts, add a mail
    command in the alert section. For Slack/PagerDuty integration, you'll need to
    add webhook calls (examples in comments). The Master Pack includes pre-built integrations
    for 15+ notification channels with intelligent alert routing.
- question: Can this script monitor multiple Odoo instances?
  answer: Yes, copy the script and configure each instance separately. Use different
    log files for each instance. For centralized monitoring of multiple instances
    with unified dashboards, consider the Master Pack Operations Console which aggregates
    metrics across all your Odoo deployments.
- question: What metrics should I monitor for optimal Odoo performance?
  answer: 'Essential metrics: CPU usage (alert >80%), memory usage (alert >85%), disk
    space (alert >80%), PostgreSQL connections (alert >80% of max_connections), worker
    availability, HTTP response time (alert >2s). The script monitors all of these
    by default with production-tested thresholds.'
