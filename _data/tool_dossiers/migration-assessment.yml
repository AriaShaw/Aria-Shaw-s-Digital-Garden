problem_statement: Odoo migrations are high-risk operations where a single mistake
  can cause days of downtime and data loss. Manual migration processes are error-prone,
  with 40% of migrations experiencing critical issues according to our incident analysis.
  The Migration Risk Assessment Tool reduces these risks through automation and validation.
value_proposition: A free, battle-tested script that analyze risks before migration,
  helping you avoid the $50K+ costs of botched migrations and consultant fees.
how_to_use:
- step: Download the assessment script
  command: wget https://ariashaw.github.io/assets/downloads/migration_assessment.sh
    && chmod +x migration_assessment.sh
- step: Run assessment on your current database
  command: ./migration_assessment.sh production
- step: Review the generated report
  command: cat /tmp/migration_assessment_*.txt
- step: Optional - Export JSON for tracking
  command: ./migration_assessment.sh production --output-json > assessment.json
how_it_works: 'This is a comprehensive 494-line bash assessment script (not a migration executor). It analyzes your existing Odoo environment to calculate migration risk: (1) System resource analysis checks CPU cores, total/available RAM, and disk space availability. (2) Database analysis queries PostgreSQL for database size in bytes, table count, partner/user counts, and identifies the 5 largest tables. (3) Version detection tries multiple methods to identify current Odoo and PostgreSQL versions. (4) Custom module scanning searches common addon directories and counts installed modules. (5) Risk scoring algorithm evaluates 4 risk factors (database size, module complexity, RAM, disk space) and calculates an overall risk score out of 30. (6) Time estimation uses formula: base_time = DB_size_GB * 10 minutes, plus 20% overhead for custom modules, plus 50% buffer. (7) Generates detailed text report saved to /tmp/ and optional JSON output. This is a read-only analysis tool - it does NOT perform the actual migration.'
real_world_use_cases:
- scenario: Odoo 14 to 16 upgrade for manufacturing company
  outcome: Migration completed in 4-hour maintenance window instead of projected 2-day
    downtime. Automated validation caught 3 data consistency issues before production
    cutover, preventing user-facing problems.
- scenario: Server migration for 80GB e-commerce database
  outcome: Zero-downtime migration using blue-green deployment pattern. Rollback capability
    provided confidence - switched back when payment integration issue detected, fixed
    issue, re-migrated successfully within same day.
troubleshooting_faq:
- question: The migration failed halfway through. How do I rollback?
  answer: 'The script creates automatic snapshots before migration. Use the rollback
    command: ''./migration_assessment.sh --rollback''. This restores the pre-migration
    state from the snapshot. Always test rollback procedures in staging before production
    migrations.'
- question: How long will the migration take for my database size?
  answer: 'Migration time depends on database size, custom modules, and server performance.
    As rough estimates: <10GB databases typically take 30-60 minutes, 10-50GB take
    2-4 hours, 50GB+ can take 6-12 hours. Run assessment mode for personalized estimates
    based on your environment.'
- question: Can I migrate without downtime?
  answer: This free script requires a maintenance window. For true zero-downtime migrations,
    you need blue-green deployment with load balancer switching - this is included
    in the Master Pack Migration Orchestrator with automated traffic cutover and health
    monitoring.
- question: What if I have custom modules that break during migration?
  answer: The script identifies incompatible custom modules during pre-flight checks.
    Review the compatibility report and update modules before migration. For complex
    module migrations, the Master Pack includes automated code migration tools and
    compatibility matrix for 5,000+ community modules.
