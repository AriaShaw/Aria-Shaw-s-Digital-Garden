problem_statement: Webhook integrations fail silently in production, causing missed
  data synchronizations and business process disruptions. Without proper testing,
  you only discover webhook failures when critical data is already lost. Manual webhook
  testing is time-consuming and error-prone, especially with signature validation.
value_proposition: A free webhook testing tool that simulates payloads, validates
  endpoints, and logs responses - helping you catch integration issues before they
  impact production without expensive API testing platforms.
how_to_use:
- step: Download and install
  command: wget https://ariashaw.com/assets/downloads/webhook_tester.py && chmod
    +x webhook_tester.py
- step: Test webhook with default payload
  command: python3 webhook_tester.py https://your-odoo.com/webhook/endpoint
- step: Test with specific event type
  command: python3 webhook_tester.py https://your-odoo.com/webhook/endpoint --payload-type
    payment_received
- step: Test with signature validation
  command: python3 webhook_tester.py https://your-odoo.com/webhook/endpoint --secret
    your_webhook_secret
how_it_works: This Python script simulates webhook POST requests with customizable
  payloads. It includes 3 built-in payload templates (order_created, customer_updated,
  payment_received) with realistic data structures. The script generates HMAC-SHA256
  signatures when a secret is provided, sends the payload with proper headers, measures
  response time, and validates HTTP status codes. Supports custom timeouts and logs
  full request/response details for debugging. No persistent logging or retry simulation
  - designed for ad-hoc testing and debugging webhook endpoints during integration
  development.
real_world_use_cases:
- scenario: E-commerce integration with payment gateway
  outcome: Discovered webhook signature mismatch before production deployment. Testing
    revealed incorrect HMAC algorithm implementation, preventing payment notification
    failures that would have caused order fulfillment delays.
- scenario: Multi-system inventory synchronization
  outcome: Identified webhook timeout issues (endpoint taking 35s to respond) during
    load testing. Implemented async processing and reduced response time to 2s, preventing
    webhook retry storms that would have overwhelmed the system.
troubleshooting_faq:
- question: How do I test webhooks with custom payload structures?
  answer: Edit the SAMPLE_PAYLOADS dictionary in the script to add your custom payload
    templates. You can also pass JSON files using shell redirection. The script validates
    JSON syntax before sending. For complex payload generation, consider the Master
    Pack webhook testing suite with template builder.
- question: My webhook endpoint requires authentication headers. How do I add them?
  answer: The script supports custom headers but requires code modification (add
    to default_headers dict). For production testing with multiple auth methods (OAuth,
    Bearer tokens, API keys), the Master Pack includes pre-configured authentication
    profiles for 50+ common APIs.
- question: How can I simulate webhook retry logic?
  answer: This free script sends single requests only. For retry simulation, wrap
    it in a bash loop with delays. The Master Pack includes built-in retry logic
    with exponential backoff, jitter, and failure analysis to test how your system
    handles webhook delivery failures.
- question: Can this tool test webhook security (signature validation)?
  answer: Yes, use --secret flag to generate HMAC-SHA256 signatures. The script
    adds X-Webhook-Signature header automatically. For testing other signature algorithms
    (SHA1, SHA512) or custom security schemes, you will need to modify the generate_signature
    function or use the Master Pack multi-algorithm validator.
