problem_statement: Data integration failures caused by incorrect field mappings
  cost businesses thousands in lost data, duplicate records, and manual cleanup.
  Without validation, mapping errors only surface in production when critical business
  data has already been corrupted. Manual mapping verification is tedious and error-prone,
  especially for complex nested structures.
value_proposition: A free data mapping validator that automatically verifies field
  mappings, tests data type conversions, and identifies missing fields - helping
  you catch integration errors before production deployment without expensive data
  quality tools.
how_to_use:
- step: Create mapping configuration file (JSON)
  command: 'cat > mapping.json <<EOF

    {"field_mappings": [

    {"source_field": "customer.name", "target_field": "partner.name", "target_type":
    "string"},

    {"source_field": "order.total", "target_field": "sale.amount_total", "target_type":
    "float"}

    ]}

    EOF'
- step: Create sample source data file
  command: 'cat > source_data.json <<EOF

    {"customer": {"name": "Acme Corp"}, "order": {"total": 1250.50}}

    EOF'
- step: Validate mappings
  command: python3 data_mapping_validator.py mapping.json source_data.json
- step: Save validation report
  command: python3 data_mapping_validator.py mapping.json source_data.json --output
    validation_report.json
how_it_works: This Python script reads a JSON mapping configuration defining source-to-target
  field mappings with optional data type conversions and transformations. It validates
  that source fields exist in sample data, extracts nested field values using dot
  notation (e.g., customer.contact.email), applies transformations (uppercase, lowercase,
  type conversions, trim), validates target data types match specifications, and
  generates detailed validation reports with errors and warnings. Supports 6 data
  types (string, integer, float, boolean, array, object) and 6 transformations. No
  actual data synchronization or automated mapping generation - designed for pre-deployment
  validation of manually configured mappings.
real_world_use_cases:
- scenario: Shopify to Odoo e-commerce integration
  outcome: Discovered 15 mapping errors before production launch, including incorrect
    currency field (string instead of float) and missing customer phone number mapping.
    Prevented data quality issues that would have caused 3,200 orders to import with
    incorrect totals.
- scenario: Legacy ERP to Odoo migration (50,000 records)
  outcome: Identified nested field access errors (customer.billing_address.country
    vs customer.country) during mapping validation. Fixed before migration, avoiding
    data loss that would have required manual correction of 12,000 customer records.
troubleshooting_faq:
- question: How do I validate mappings with conditional logic (if-else transformations)?
  answer: This free script supports basic transformations only. For conditional mappings,
    you need to preprocess data or add custom transformation functions to the script.
    The Master Pack includes rule-based transformation engine with 50+ built-in functions
    including if-else, lookup tables, regex replacement, and date/time formatting.
- question: Can this tool detect data loss when mapping complex objects to simple
    fields?
  answer: The script validates type compatibility but doesn't warn about information
    loss (e.g., mapping address object to single string field). You need to review
    type_mismatches in the report manually. The Master Pack includes data loss analysis
    with automatic warnings for lossy transformations and suggestions for alternative
    mappings.
- question: How do I validate mappings for array/list fields with variable lengths?
  answer: The script validates array type but doesn't check array element types or
    lengths. For array element validation, provide sample data with representative
    arrays. The Master Pack includes deep array validation with element-level type
    checking and cardinality constraints (min/max length).
- question: Can this tool auto-generate mapping configurations from sample data?
  answer: No, this free script validates existing mappings only. You must manually
    create mapping.json file. For automatic mapping discovery using ML-based field
    matching, use the Master Pack Intelligent Mapping Engine which analyzes source
    and target schemas to suggest optimal mappings based on field names and data
    patterns.
