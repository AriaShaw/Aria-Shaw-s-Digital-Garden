problem_statement: Weekly VACUUM, ANALYZE, REINDEX. Essential PostgreSQL maintenance
  preventing performance degradation. is a common challenge in Odoo deployments that
  leads to inefficiencies, errors, and wasted time. Manual processes are inconsistent
  and don't scale. The Weekly VACUUM, ANALYZE, REINDEX automates this critical task.
value_proposition: A free, production-ready script that weekly vacuum, analyze, reindex,
  saving you hours of manual work and reducing error rates.
how_to_use:
- step: Download the script
  command: wget https://ariashaw.github.io/assets/downloads/db_maintenance.sh && chmod
    +x db_maintenance.sh
- step: Configure parameters
  command: 'nano db_maintenance.sh  # Review and customize settings'
- step: Test in safe mode
  command: ./db_maintenance.sh --dry-run
- step: Execute the operation
  command: ./db_maintenance.sh
how_it_works: 'This is a simple 15-line shell script that runs standard PostgreSQL
  maintenance commands: (1) Connects to the specified database, (2) Runs VACUUM to
  reclaim space, (3) Runs ANALYZE to update statistics, (4) Runs REINDEX to rebuild
  indexes. There is no scheduling logic, no error recovery, no logging to files -
  it simply executes these commands sequentially and outputs results to stdout. Schedule
  it with cron for regular execution. For advanced features like intelligent scheduling,
  performance impact monitoring, and automated rollback, see the Master Pack.'
real_world_use_cases:
- scenario: Company needing to perform routine Odoo operations
  outcome: Automated repetitive task that previously took 2 hours weekly. Reduced
    error rate from 15% to <1%. Freed up staff time for higher-value activities.
- scenario: Organization with compliance requirements
  outcome: Script-based automation provided audit trail demonstrating consistent process
    execution. Automated logging satisfied compliance requirements without additional
    documentation effort.
troubleshooting_faq:
- question: The script is not working as expected. How do I troubleshoot?
  answer: 'Enable debug mode: ''./db_maintenance.sh --debug''. Review log file at
    /var/log/odoo-operations.log. Check that all prerequisites are met (permissions,
    dependencies, disk space). Run in dry-run mode first to see what would be changed
    without making actual modifications.'
- question: Can I customize this script for my specific needs?
  answer: Yes, the script is open source under MIT license. Review the code, modify
    as needed, and test thoroughly. Common customizations are documented in inline
    comments. For complex modifications, consider the Master Pack which includes GUI-based
    configuration and professional support.
- question: Is this safe to run in production?
  answer: This script is production-tested but always test in staging first. Use --dry-run
    mode to preview changes. Ensure you have current backups before any production
    changes. The script includes safety checks, but you are responsible for validating
    it meets your specific requirements.
- question: How do I get support if I encounter issues?
  answer: This is a free community script with best-effort support. Check documentation,
    review GitHub issues, or ask in community forums. For guaranteed support SLAs,
    priority bug fixes, and hands-on assistance, upgrade to the Master Pack which
    includes direct email support.
