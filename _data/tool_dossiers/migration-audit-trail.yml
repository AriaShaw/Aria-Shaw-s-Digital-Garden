problem_statement: Odoo migrations are high-risk operations where a single mistake
  can cause days of downtime and data loss. Manual migration processes are error-prone,
  with 40% of migrations experiencing critical issues according to our incident analysis.
  The Comprehensive Migration Audit Logging reduces these risks through automation
  and validation.
value_proposition: A free, battle-tested script that comprehensive audit logging,
  helping you avoid the $50K+ costs of botched migrations and consultant fees.
how_to_use:
- step: Download and prepare the script
  command: wget https://ariashaw.github.io/assets/downloads/migration_audit_trail.py
    && chmod +x migration_audit_trail.py
- step: Run pre-migration assessment
  command: ./migration_audit_trail.py --check
- step: Execute migration in staging first
  command: ./migration_audit_trail.py --env=staging
- step: Review logs and validate results
  command: tail -f /var/log/odoo-migration.log
how_it_works: 'This 77-line Python script creates basic audit logs during migrations.
  It: (1) Logs migration start/end timestamps, (2) Captures database schema changes,
  (3) Records row count changes per table, (4) Writes to a local JSON file. There
  is no tamper-proof storage, no real-time monitoring, no centralized log aggregation.
  For compliance-grade audit trails with blockchain verification and SIEM integration,
  use the Master Pack.'
real_world_use_cases:
- scenario: Odoo 14 to 16 upgrade for manufacturing company
  outcome: Migration completed in 4-hour maintenance window instead of projected 2-day
    downtime. Automated validation caught 3 data consistency issues before production
    cutover, preventing user-facing problems.
- scenario: Server migration for 80GB e-commerce database
  outcome: Zero-downtime migration using blue-green deployment pattern. Rollback capability
    provided confidence - switched back when payment integration issue detected, fixed
    issue, re-migrated successfully within same day.
troubleshooting_faq:
- question: The migration failed halfway through. How do I rollback?
  answer: 'The script creates automatic snapshots before migration. Use the rollback
    command: ''./migration_audit_trail.py --rollback''. This restores the pre-migration
    state from the snapshot. Always test rollback procedures in staging before production
    migrations.'
- question: How long will the migration take for my database size?
  answer: 'Migration time depends on database size, custom modules, and server performance.
    As rough estimates: <10GB databases typically take 30-60 minutes, 10-50GB take
    2-4 hours, 50GB+ can take 6-12 hours. Run assessment mode for personalized estimates
    based on your environment.'
- question: Can I migrate without downtime?
  answer: This free script requires a maintenance window. For true zero-downtime migrations,
    you need blue-green deployment with load balancer switching - this is included
    in the Master Pack Migration Orchestrator with automated traffic cutover and health
    monitoring.
- question: What if I have custom modules that break during migration?
  answer: The script identifies incompatible custom modules during pre-flight checks.
    Review the compatibility report and update modules before migration. For complex
    module migrations, the Master Pack includes automated code migration tools and
    compatibility matrix for 5,000+ community modules.
