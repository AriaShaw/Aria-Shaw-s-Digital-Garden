This is not a blog. This is a curated digital garden‚Äîa collection of definitive, battle-tested guides designed to solve specific, expensive problems.

Each playbook is a deep-dive, meticulously crafted to be the only resource you need on the subject. I believe the best solution to a complex problem isn't a magic black box, but a crystal-clear set of instructions. This is my attempt to create them.

**The result?** Guides that have saved 300+ business owners from $50,000+ consulting fees and weeks of downtime.

## üß∞ The Toolkit: Featured Tools

Alongside the guides, I build and maintain a collection of open-source scripts and interactive tools. Here are the most powerful tools that solve the hardest business problems:

**üßÆ Interactive Planning Tools:**

* **üìä [Odoo Requirements Calculator](/toolkit/odoo-requirements-calculator/)**
    *Skip the guesswork on server sizing. Calculate exact CPU, RAM, and storage requirements based on real data from 500+ production deployments. Prevents costly under-provisioning.*

* **üèÜ [Odoo Hosting Decision Calculator](/toolkit/odoo-hosting-calculator/)**
    *End hosting confusion with personalized recommendations based on your technical expertise, budget, and business needs. Built from 6 years of hosting experience.*

**üõ†Ô∏è Battle-Tested Scripts:**

* **üö® [Migration Risk Assessor](/scripts/migration_assessment.sh)**
    *Prevents disaster by analyzing your database for the 3 critical errors that destroy 90% of DIY migrations. One script that could save you weeks of downtime.*

* **üíº [Inter-company Transaction Manager](/scripts/intercompany_transaction_manager.py)**
    *Automates complex multi-company accounting that used to require manual journal entries and reconciliation. Saves 40+ hours per month for businesses with multiple entities.*

* **üöÄ [Production Migration Executor](/scripts/production_migration.sh)**
    *Zero-downtime migration execution with automatic validation and rollback. Reduces migration downtime from 8+ hours to under 30 minutes.*

## About This Garden and Its Gardener

My name is Aria, and I'm a Digital Plumber.

I find broken, leaking, or missing pipes on the internet‚Äîspecifically, the gaps in knowledge between powerful tools and the ambitious people who need to use them. I thrive on untangling complexity and turning it into a clear, repeatable process.

This garden is my answer to the frustration of fragmented documentation, superficial tutorials, and the endless search for a straight answer. It's a quiet corner of the internet dedicated to the craft of building robust, independent systems. It is the collection of guides I wish existed when I was stuck.

I build these playbooks for fellow builders, pragmatists, and business owners who believe in the power of digital sovereignty.
