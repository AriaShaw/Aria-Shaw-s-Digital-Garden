  deployment_architecture: Application tier and database tier run on separate servers.
    Application handles Odoo workers and reverse proxy, while database tier runs PostgreSQL
    with optimized configuration. Provides better resource isolation and independent
    scaling capabilities.
  scaling_strategy: 'Independent horizontal scaling: Add application servers behind
    load balancer for increased request capacity. Scale database tier vertically with
    RAM and CPU upgrades. Implement read replicas for reporting workloads if needed.'
  cost_optimization: Right-size each tier independently - database tier requires high
    RAM but fewer CPU cores, while application tier benefits from more balanced resources.
    Use reserved instances or savings plans for predictable workloads to reduce cloud
    costs by 30-50%.
  architecture_recommendations: Separated architecture offers excellent balance between
    complexity and scalability for mid-sized deployments. Implement connection pooling
    (PgBouncer), session management (Redis), and automated backups. Monitor each tier
    independently for bottleneck identification.
  performance_context: At 200 concurrent users, expect 3000 daily transactions with
    peak load reaching 300 simultaneous connections. Worker processes should maintain
    <200ms average response time under normal load. Database query optimization becomes
    critical above 160 active users.
  scale_context: Medium scale deployment supporting 200 concurrent users. System handles
    approximately 30000 page views per day with 600 database transactions per minute
    during peak hours. Requires 32GB RAM and 16 CPU cores for optimal performance.

  introduction: 'Odoo infrastructure capacity planning prevents two expensive mistakes
    businesses make when deploying ERP systems: over-provisioning hardware that wastes
    capital on unused server capacity, and under-provisioning servers that degrade
    user experience through slow page loads, database timeouts, and system crashes
    during peak usage periods. The calculation work you perform today—determining
    CPU core requirements, calibrating RAM allocation, estimating IOPS demand, planning
    storage growth—establishes infrastructure foundations that support business operations
    for eighteen to thirty-six months before requiring architectural revision.


    Right-sizing your Odoo deployment requires understanding three interconnected
    factors that collectively determine infrastructure requirements. First, concurrent
    user count drives CPU and memory demand—ten users editing sales orders simultaneously
    creates fundamentally different resource consumption than one hundred users processing
    accounting transactions, managing warehouse transfers, and generating purchase
    requisitions concurrently. Second, transaction volume and data growth patterns
    determine storage capacity and I/O performance requirements—businesses processing
    five thousand sales orders monthly need different disk configurations than organizations
    handling five hundred orders with equivalent user counts. Third, module selection
    and customization depth affect resource consumption—vanilla Odoo installations
    consume markedly less CPU and RAM than heavily customized deployments with complex
    automated actions, scheduled reports, and third-party module integrations.


    This capacity planning guide provides hardware sizing calculations based on documented
    production deployments serving real business workloads, not theoretical maximums
    or vendor marketing claims. The specifications you''ll find here reflect actual
    resource consumption patterns observed across manufacturing companies, wholesale
    distributors, and service businesses running Odoo at scale—deployments that successfully
    serve their user populations without performance degradation or frequent infrastructure
    emergencies requiring emergency hardware upgrades.

  main_content: 'Sizing an Odoo 18 server for 200 concurrent users requires understanding
    the relationship between user activity patterns, database workload, and hardware
    resources. Medium scale deployment supporting 200 concurrent users. System handles
    approximately 30000 page views per day with 600 database transactions per minute
    during peak hours. Requires 32GB RAM and 16 CPU cores for optimal performance.


    ## Hardware Specifications and Resource Allocation


    For 200 users running Odoo 18, the recommended hardware configuration includes
    16 CPU cores, 32GB RAM, and 1000GB disk storage. These specifications account
    for PostgreSQL database operations (40% of resource consumption), Odoo application
    workers (35%), and system overhead (25%). The minimum viable configuration uses
    8 cores and 19GB RAM, but this leaves no headroom for traffic spikes or module-intensive
    operations like MRP calculations or inventory revaluations.


    Separated architecture offers excellent balance between complexity and scalability
    for mid-sized deployments. Implement connection pooling (PgBouncer), session management
    (Redis), and automated backups. Monitor each tier independently for bottleneck
    identification.


    ## Database Connection Pooling and Worker Configuration


    The database connection pool should maintain 300 connections to handle concurrent
    user requests without connection exhaustion. Odoo worker processes—set to 16—determine
    simultaneous request handling capacity. Each worker consumes approximately 384MB
    RAM, so total worker memory footprint reaches 6.0GB, leaving 26GB for PostgreSQL
    caching and operating system operations.


    ## Performance Parameters and Scaling Triggers


    At 200 concurrent users, expect 3000 daily transactions with peak load reaching
    300 simultaneous connections. Worker processes should maintain <200ms average
    response time under normal load. Database query optimization becomes critical
    above 160 active users.


    Monitor server performance metrics to detect when hardware becomes the bottleneck:
    CPU utilization consistently above 70% during business hours indicates insufficient
    processing power, RAM utilization above 85% causes disk swap and performance degradation,
    and database query times exceeding 500ms suggest either inefficient queries or
    inadequate PostgreSQL memory allocation.


    ## Architecture Patterns for Different Scales


    Application tier and database tier run on separate servers. Application handles
    Odoo workers and reverse proxy, while database tier runs PostgreSQL with optimized
    configuration. Provides better resource isolation and independent scaling capabilities.


    ## Vertical vs. Horizontal Scaling Strategy


    Independent horizontal scaling: Add application servers behind load balancer for
    increased request capacity. Scale database tier vertically with RAM and CPU upgrades.
    Implement read replicas for reporting workloads if needed.


    ## Cost-Performance Optimization


    Right-size each tier independently - database tier requires high RAM but fewer
    CPU cores, while application tier benefits from more balanced resources. Use reserved
    instances or savings plans for predictable workloads to reduce cloud costs by
    30-50%.


    Cloud providers offer various instance types optimized for different workloads.
    For Odoo deployments supporting 200 users, compute-optimized instances provide
    better performance per dollar than general-purpose instances because Odoo''s worker
    model benefits from higher CPU clock speeds rather than core count alone. Monitor
    actual resource utilization during peak business hours—overprovisioning costs
    30-50% more than right-sized infrastructure, while underprovisioning causes user
    frustration and productivity loss.

    '
  conclusion: 'Your capacity planning work established infrastructure specifications
    matching actual business requirements rather than arbitrary hardware purchases
    or vendor recommendations divorced from operational reality. The calculations
    you completed—CPU core allocation supporting concurrent user workloads, RAM sizing
    accommodating PostgreSQL caching requirements, storage capacity planning for database
    growth trajectories, IOPS provisioning for transaction throughput demands—provide
    foundation supporting business operations for eighteen to thirty-six months before
    architectural revision becomes necessary. This infrastructure investment eliminates
    performance bottlenecks that would otherwise constrain business growth, user productivity,
    and customer-facing operations.


    Validate your capacity planning accuracy through systematic performance monitoring
    during initial production deployment. Install monitoring tools capturing CPU utilization
    patterns, memory consumption under representative workloads, PostgreSQL query
    execution statistics, and disk I/O metrics across typical business cycles. Establish
    performance baselines during first ninety days documenting resource consumption
    for normal operations—month-end close procedures, inventory count processing,
    sales order entry during peak periods, report generation workloads. These baselines
    enable proactive capacity management identifying degradation trends before performance
    problems impact business operations and inform future infrastructure expansion
    decisions through measured growth data rather than speculation.


    Review infrastructure capacity quarterly comparing actual resource utilization
    against planned headroom built into your capacity calculations. If CPU utilization
    consistently exceeds seventy percent during normal operations or peaks above ninety
    percent during month-end processing, schedule compute capacity expansion before
    performance degradation becomes user-visible. If database sizes approach eighty
    percent of provisioned storage, plan storage expansion to prevent emergency disk
    space crises requiring urgent maintenance windows. If PostgreSQL connection counts
    approach configured maximums, investigate connection pooling optimizations or
    plan database tier scaling. The operational discipline of regular capacity review
    prevents infrastructure emergencies through predictive management rather than
    reactive firefighting when systems fail under unexpected load.
