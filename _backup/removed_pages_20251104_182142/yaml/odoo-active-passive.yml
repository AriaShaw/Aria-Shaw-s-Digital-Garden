  deployment_architecture: Multi-tier clustered architecture with load-balanced application
    servers, replicated database tier, and distributed file storage. Provides high
    availability, fault tolerance, and horizontal scalability for enterprise deployments.
  scaling_strategy: 'Horizontal scaling across all tiers: Add application servers
    dynamically based on load, implement database read replicas for reporting, use
    distributed file storage (S3/NFS) with CDN for static assets. Auto-scaling groups
    respond to traffic spikes automatically.'
  cost_optimization: Leverage auto-scaling to match resources with demand patterns.
    Use spot instances for non-critical application workers (30-70% cost reduction).
    Implement aggressive caching layers (Redis, Varnish, CDN) to reduce database load
    and downstream costs.
  architecture_recommendations: Clustered architecture provides enterprise-grade reliability
    and scalability but requires significant operational expertise. Implement comprehensive
    monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana), automated failover, disaster recovery procedures,
    and regular chaos engineering tests.
  performance_context: At 500 concurrent users, expect 7500 daily transactions with
    peak load reaching 750 simultaneous connections. Worker processes should maintain
    <200ms average response time under normal load. Database query optimization becomes
    critical above 400 active users.
  scale_context: Large scale deployment supporting 500 concurrent users. System handles
    approximately 75000 page views per day with 1500 database transactions per minute
    during peak hours. Requires 80GB RAM and 40 CPU cores for optimal performance.

  introduction: 'Single-server Odoo deployments suffice for businesses with ten to
    fifty concurrent users performing typical ERP operations—data entry, report generation,
    approval workflows—but architectural limitations emerge as organizations grow
    beyond those boundaries. When your user population approaches seventy-five to
    one hundred concurrent users, performance degradation manifests through increasing
    page load times, database query timeouts during peak usage periods, and unacceptable
    response latency for customer-facing operations like e-commerce order processing
    or point-of-sale transactions. These symptoms signal that your infrastructure
    requirements exceed single-server capacity and demand multi-tier architecture
    planning.


    Capacity planning for larger Odoo deployments requires understanding three distinct
    architecture patterns that serve different operational requirements and budget
    constraints. Separated application and database tiers—where Odoo application servers
    and PostgreSQL database servers run on dedicated hardware—provide the foundation
    for serving one hundred to three hundred concurrent users while maintaining sub-second
    page response times. This architecture enables independent scaling of compute
    resources (adding application servers) and storage resources (upgrading database
    server IOPS) as business growth drives different bottlenecks. Load-balanced multi-server
    deployments extend capacity to five hundred concurrent users through horizontal
    application server scaling combined with PostgreSQL streaming replication for
    read query distribution. High-availability clusters implementing active-passive
    or active-active PostgreSQL configurations eliminate single points of failure
    and provide business continuity during hardware failures or planned maintenance
    windows.


    The architecture pattern you select today constrains operational flexibility and
    expansion paths for the next two to four years until major infrastructure refreshes
    justify migration efforts. Businesses that initially deploy single-server installations
    discover that migrating to separated tiers after accumulating production data,
    customizations, and operational dependencies requires significant planning, testing,
    and migration downtime—work that could have been avoided through appropriate initial
    architecture selection. This capacity planning guide helps you match infrastructure
    architecture to your actual business requirements—considering not just current
    user counts but planned growth trajectories, availability requirements that determine
    acceptable downtime windows, and operational complexity tolerance that affects
    ongoing infrastructure management burden.

  main_content: 'Sizing an Odoo 18 server for 500 concurrent users requires understanding
    the relationship between user activity patterns, database workload, and hardware
    resources. Large scale deployment supporting 500 concurrent users. System handles
    approximately 75000 page views per day with 1500 database transactions per minute
    during peak hours. Requires 80GB RAM and 40 CPU cores for optimal performance.


    ## Hardware Specifications and Resource Allocation


    For 500 users running Odoo 18, the recommended hardware configuration includes
    40 CPU cores, 80GB RAM, and 2500GB disk storage. These specifications account
    for PostgreSQL database operations (40% of resource consumption), Odoo application
    workers (35%), and system overhead (25%). The minimum viable configuration uses
    20 cores and 48GB RAM, but this leaves no headroom for traffic spikes or module-intensive
    operations like MRP calculations or inventory revaluations.


    Clustered architecture provides enterprise-grade reliability and scalability but
    requires significant operational expertise. Implement comprehensive monitoring
    (Prometheus, Grafana), automated failover, disaster recovery procedures, and regular
    chaos engineering tests.


    ## Database Connection Pooling and Worker Configuration


    The database connection pool should maintain 750 connections to handle concurrent
    user requests without connection exhaustion. Odoo worker processes—set to 40—determine
    simultaneous request handling capacity. Each worker consumes approximately 512MB
    RAM, so total worker memory footprint reaches 20.0GB, leaving 60GB for PostgreSQL
    caching and operating system operations.


    ## Performance Parameters and Scaling Triggers


    At 500 concurrent users, expect 7500 daily transactions with peak load reaching
    750 simultaneous connections. Worker processes should maintain <200ms average
    response time under normal load. Database query optimization becomes critical
    above 400 active users.


    Monitor server performance metrics to detect when hardware becomes the bottleneck:
    CPU utilization consistently above 70% during business hours indicates insufficient
    processing power, RAM utilization above 85% causes disk swap and performance degradation,
    and database query times exceeding 500ms suggest either inefficient queries or
    inadequate PostgreSQL memory allocation.


    ## Architecture Patterns for Different Scales


    Multi-tier clustered architecture with load-balanced application servers, replicated
    database tier, and distributed file storage. Provides high availability, fault
    tolerance, and horizontal scalability for enterprise deployments.


    ## Vertical vs. Horizontal Scaling Strategy


    Horizontal scaling across all tiers: Add application servers dynamically based
    on load, implement database read replicas for reporting, use distributed file
    storage (S3/NFS) with CDN for static assets. Auto-scaling groups respond to traffic
    spikes automatically.


    ## Cost-Performance Optimization


    Leverage auto-scaling to match resources with demand patterns. Use spot instances
    for non-critical application workers (30-70% cost reduction). Implement aggressive
    caching layers (Redis, Varnish, CDN) to reduce database load and downstream costs.


    Cloud providers offer various instance types optimized for different workloads.
    For Odoo deployments supporting 500 users, compute-optimized instances provide
    better performance per dollar than general-purpose instances because Odoo''s worker
    model benefits from higher CPU clock speeds rather than core count alone. Monitor
    actual resource utilization during peak business hours—overprovisioning costs
    30-50% more than right-sized infrastructure, while underprovisioning causes user
    frustration and productivity loss.

    '
  conclusion: 'Capacity planning provides infrastructure foundations supporting business
    operations, but configuration optimization extracts maximum performance from provisioned
    hardware avoiding premature capacity expansion through efficiency improvements.
    The PostgreSQL tuning parameters you configured—shared_buffers calibrated for
    available RAM, work_mem sized preventing disk-based query execution, effective_cache_size
    informing query planner decisions—transform adequate hardware into high-performing
    infrastructure. Odoo worker process configuration balancing parallelism against
    memory consumption prevents both CPU underutilization from insufficient workers
    and out-of-memory failures from excessive worker allocation. These optimization
    efforts typically deliver twenty to thirty percent performance gains without hardware
    additions.


    Monitor production performance identifying optimization opportunities before capacity
    expansion becomes necessary. Database query analysis reveals inefficient queries
    consuming disproportionate resources—adding indexes eliminates expensive sequential
    scans, query rewrites reduce result set sizes, materialized views cache complex
    aggregations. Connection pooling reduces PostgreSQL overhead from excessive connection
    establishment and termination cycles. Redis session storage offloads session management
    from PostgreSQL reducing database write operations. Application-level caching
    eliminates redundant database queries for frequently accessed data. These optimizations
    extend existing infrastructure capacity delaying expensive hardware upgrades while
    improving user experience through faster response times.


    Establish performance regression testing preventing configuration changes or code
    deployments from degrading system efficiency. Baseline query performance metrics
    before major Odoo version upgrades capturing execution times for representative
    business operations—sales order creation, invoice generation, inventory transfers,
    accounting report production. Compare post-upgrade performance against baselines
    identifying regression requiring optimization before completing deployment to
    production environments. Monitor long-running query frequencies detecting gradual
    performance degradation as data volumes grow requiring index additions or query
    optimization. Track memory consumption patterns identifying worker process memory
    leaks requiring Odoo restart schedules or module debugging. This performance discipline
    prevents the gradual degradation where systems slowly become unusable without
    obvious single failure point triggering investigation.



    Don''t wait for users to report problems. Download the [Odoo health monitoring
    script](/downloads/odoo-health-monitoring-script/) to track CPU, memory, PostgreSQL
    performance, and response times with automated alerts when thresholds breach.'
