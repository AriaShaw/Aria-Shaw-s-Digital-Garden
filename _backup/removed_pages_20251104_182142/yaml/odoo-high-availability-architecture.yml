  deployment_architecture: Multi-tier clustered architecture with load-balanced application
    servers, replicated database tier, and distributed file storage. Provides high
    availability, fault tolerance, and horizontal scalability for enterprise deployments.
  scaling_strategy: 'Horizontal scaling across all tiers: Add application servers
    dynamically based on load, implement database read replicas for reporting, use
    distributed file storage (S3/NFS) with CDN for static assets. Auto-scaling groups
    respond to traffic spikes automatically.'
  cost_optimization: Leverage auto-scaling to match resources with demand patterns.
    Use spot instances for non-critical application workers (30-70% cost reduction).
    Implement aggressive caching layers (Redis, Varnish, CDN) to reduce database load
    and downstream costs.
  architecture_recommendations: Clustered architecture provides enterprise-grade reliability
    and scalability but requires significant operational expertise. Implement comprehensive
    monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana), automated failover, disaster recovery procedures,
    and regular chaos engineering tests.
  performance_context: At 1000 concurrent users, expect 15000 daily transactions with
    peak load reaching 1500 simultaneous connections. Worker processes should maintain
    <200ms average response time under normal load. Database query optimization becomes
    critical above 800 active users.
  scale_context: Large scale deployment supporting 1000 concurrent users. System handles
    approximately 150000 page views per day with 3000 database transactions per minute
    during peak hours. Requires 160GB RAM and 80 CPU cores for optimal performance.

  introduction: 'Odoo infrastructure capacity planning prevents two expensive mistakes
    businesses make when deploying ERP systems: over-provisioning hardware that wastes
    capital on unused server capacity, and under-provisioning servers that degrade
    user experience through slow page loads, database timeouts, and system crashes
    during peak usage periods. The calculation work you perform today—determining
    CPU core requirements, calibrating RAM allocation, estimating IOPS demand, planning
    storage growth—establishes infrastructure foundations that support business operations
    for eighteen to thirty-six months before requiring architectural revision.


    Right-sizing your Odoo deployment requires understanding three interconnected
    factors that collectively determine infrastructure requirements. First, concurrent
    user count drives CPU and memory demand—ten users editing sales orders simultaneously
    creates fundamentally different resource consumption than one hundred users processing
    accounting transactions, managing warehouse transfers, and generating purchase
    requisitions concurrently. Second, transaction volume and data growth patterns
    determine storage capacity and I/O performance requirements—businesses processing
    five thousand sales orders monthly need different disk configurations than organizations
    handling five hundred orders with equivalent user counts. Third, module selection
    and customization depth affect resource consumption—vanilla Odoo installations
    consume markedly less CPU and RAM than heavily customized deployments with complex
    automated actions, scheduled reports, and third-party module integrations.


    This capacity planning guide provides hardware sizing calculations based on documented
    production deployments serving real business workloads, not theoretical maximums
    or vendor marketing claims. The specifications you''ll find here reflect actual
    resource consumption patterns observed across manufacturing companies, wholesale
    distributors, and service businesses running Odoo at scale—deployments that successfully
    serve their user populations without performance degradation or frequent infrastructure
    emergencies requiring emergency hardware upgrades.

  main_content: 'Sizing an Odoo 18 server for 1000 concurrent users requires understanding
    the relationship between user activity patterns, database workload, and hardware
    resources. Large scale deployment supporting 1000 concurrent users. System handles
    approximately 150000 page views per day with 3000 database transactions per minute
    during peak hours. Requires 160GB RAM and 80 CPU cores for optimal performance.


    ## Hardware Specifications and Resource Allocation


    For 1000 users running Odoo 18, the recommended hardware configuration includes
    80 CPU cores, 160GB RAM, and 5000GB disk storage. These specifications account
    for PostgreSQL database operations (40% of resource consumption), Odoo application
    workers (35%), and system overhead (25%). The minimum viable configuration uses
    40 cores and 96GB RAM, but this leaves no headroom for traffic spikes or module-intensive
    operations like MRP calculations or inventory revaluations.


    Clustered architecture provides enterprise-grade reliability and scalability but
    requires significant operational expertise. Implement comprehensive monitoring
    (Prometheus, Grafana), automated failover, disaster recovery procedures, and regular
    chaos engineering tests.


    ## Database Connection Pooling and Worker Configuration


    The database connection pool should maintain 1500 connections to handle concurrent
    user requests without connection exhaustion. Odoo worker processes—set to 80—determine
    simultaneous request handling capacity. Each worker consumes approximately 512MB
    RAM, so total worker memory footprint reaches 40.0GB, leaving 120GB for PostgreSQL
    caching and operating system operations.


    ## Performance Parameters and Scaling Triggers


    At 1000 concurrent users, expect 15000 daily transactions with peak load reaching
    1500 simultaneous connections. Worker processes should maintain <200ms average
    response time under normal load. Database query optimization becomes critical
    above 800 active users.


    Monitor server performance metrics to detect when hardware becomes the bottleneck:
    CPU utilization consistently above 70% during business hours indicates insufficient
    processing power, RAM utilization above 85% causes disk swap and performance degradation,
    and database query times exceeding 500ms suggest either inefficient queries or
    inadequate PostgreSQL memory allocation.


    ## Architecture Patterns for Different Scales


    Multi-tier clustered architecture with load-balanced application servers, replicated
    database tier, and distributed file storage. Provides high availability, fault
    tolerance, and horizontal scalability for enterprise deployments.


    ## Vertical vs. Horizontal Scaling Strategy


    Horizontal scaling across all tiers: Add application servers dynamically based
    on load, implement database read replicas for reporting, use distributed file
    storage (S3/NFS) with CDN for static assets. Auto-scaling groups respond to traffic
    spikes automatically.


    ## Cost-Performance Optimization


    Leverage auto-scaling to match resources with demand patterns. Use spot instances
    for non-critical application workers (30-70% cost reduction). Implement aggressive
    caching layers (Redis, Varnish, CDN) to reduce database load and downstream costs.


    Cloud providers offer various instance types optimized for different workloads.
    For Odoo deployments supporting 1000 users, compute-optimized instances provide
    better performance per dollar than general-purpose instances because Odoo''s worker
    model benefits from higher CPU clock speeds rather than core count alone. Monitor
    actual resource utilization during peak business hours—overprovisioning costs
    30-50% more than right-sized infrastructure, while underprovisioning causes user
    frustration and productivity loss.

    '
  conclusion: 'The infrastructure investment justified through capacity planning analysis
    delivers measurable return on investment beyond vague claims about "better performance"
    or "future scalability." Right-sized hardware prevents both wasteful over-provisioning
    consuming capital without delivering business value and inadequate under-provisioning
    forcing expensive emergency upgrades when production performance degrades. Calculate
    total cost of ownership across expected three-year infrastructure lifecycle including
    initial hardware or cloud instance costs, ongoing operational expenses, and avoided
    costs from performance-related business disruption to validate your capacity planning
    decisions delivered optimal spending allocation.


    Document cost comparison scenarios justifying infrastructure investment to business
    stakeholders through concrete financial analysis. Compare your selected architecture
    against cheaper alternatives explaining why reduced costs create unacceptable
    performance risks or operational limitations. Quantify potential revenue impact
    from performance-related order processing delays, inventory errors from system
    timeouts, or customer churn from slow e-commerce page loads. Estimate emergency
    upgrade costs if initial under-provisioning forces mid-cycle infrastructure expansion
    including hardware procurement delays, migration planning overhead, and business
    disruption during transition periods. These financial scenarios transform infrastructure
    spending from discretionary technology expenses into justified business investments
    with defendable ROI calculations.


    Track infrastructure ROI through operational metrics validating capacity planning
    assumptions. Monitor average page load times ensuring user interface responsiveness
    meets business requirements—Odoo pages should render within two seconds during
    normal operations with five-second maximums during peak load periods. Measure
    database query performance identifying slow queries requiring optimization or
    indicating insufficient database server capacity. Track system availability calculating
    actual uptime percentages against business requirements and comparing downtime
    incident frequencies between current infrastructure and previous environments.
    Calculate cost per user or cost per transaction normalizing infrastructure expenses
    against business volume enabling meaningful efficiency comparisons across fiscal
    periods and architectural alternatives.

    script](/downloads/odoo-health-monitoring-script/) to track CPU, memory, PostgreSQL
    performance, and response times with automated alerts when thresholds breach.'
