  introduction: '500 Internal Server Error issues in Odoo installations manifest through
    symptoms users report—database locked errors during month-end processing, timeout
    failures when generating large reports, session expired messages that force repeated
    logins—but resolving these problems requires diagnosing root causes rather than
    applying symptomatic fixes that provide temporary relief until issues resurface.
    This troubleshooting guide implements systematic diagnostic procedures: analyzing
    PostgreSQL logs for deadlock patterns, reviewing Odoo worker process configuration
    for inadequate capacity, inspecting nginx timeout settings, and testing hypothetical
    fixes in staging environments before applying them to production systems users
    depend on.

  main_content: 'Troubleshooting 500 Internal Server Error requires systematic diagnosis
    moving from symptoms to root causes—random configuration changes hoping to stumble
    onto solutions waste hours and potentially worsen problems. Users see HTTP 500
    Internal Server Error when accessing Odoo


    The temptation during production outages is making multiple changes simultaneously
    hoping one fixes the issue. This approach creates two problems: you cannot determine
    which change actually fixed the problem (making it impossible to document solution),
    and you may introduce new issues through unrelated modifications. Make one change,
    test, observe results, then proceed based on evidence.


    ## Diagnostic Methodology


    Diagnose 500 Internal Server Error by examining application server logs, checking
    service status, and reproducing the issue in a controlled environment. Use systematic
    elimination to isolate the root cause, starting with the most common issues and
    progressing to edge cases.


    Effective troubleshooting follows structured methodology: gather information,
    form hypothesis, test hypothesis, implement solution, verify resolution. Skipping
    steps leads to misdiagnosis—treating symptoms rather than underlying causes results
    in recurring problems.


    **Information Gathering**: Document exact symptoms including error messages (complete
    text, not paraphrases), steps to reproduce, affected users (everyone or specific
    accounts), timing (started when, occurs always or intermittently), and recent
    changes (system updates, configuration modifications, new module installations).


    **Log Analysis**: Examine Odoo server logs (/var/log/odoo/odoo-server.log), NGINX/Apache
    access and error logs (/var/log/nginx/), PostgreSQL logs (/var/log/postgresql/),
    and system logs (/var/log/syslog or journalctl). Search for error messages occurring
    at symptom onset time. Most problems leave log traces indicating root cause.


    **Hypothesis Formation**: Based on gathered information, form testable hypotheses
    explaining observed symptoms. Good hypotheses specify cause-and-effect relationships
    allowing verification through specific tests. Example: "Database connection timeout
    errors occur because PostgreSQL max_connections limit (100) is exhausted during
    peak usage."


    **Hypothesis Testing**: Design tests conclusively proving or disproving each hypothesis.
    Continue testing until identifying root cause—stopping at first correlation risks
    treating symptoms instead of causes.


    ## Common Problem Patterns


    Common causes of 500 Internal Server Error include misconfigured application server
    settings, insufficient system resources, network connectivity problems, or conflicting
    module dependencies. Check for recent configuration changes or system updates
    that may have triggered the issue.


    **Server Won''t Start**: Check port conflicts (another process using 8069), permission
    issues (odoo user cannot access required files), configuration syntax errors (odoo.conf
    malformed), missing Python dependencies, or PostgreSQL connectivity problems.
    Run `odoo-bin -c /etc/odoo/odoo.conf` manually observing startup messages revealing
    specific failures.


    **Slow Performance**: Profile database queries identifying slow queries consuming
    excessive time. Check worker configuration—single-worker mode serializes requests
    causing queuing delays. Monitor system resources—CPU, RAM, disk I/O exhaustion
    slows all operations. Review PostgreSQL statistics identifying missing indexes
    or table bloat requiring VACUUM.


    **Module Installation Failures**: Verify module dependencies—missing prerequisite
    modules prevent installation. Check Python dependencies—modules requiring external
    libraries fail without proper pip packages. Review module code compatibility—modules
    written for older Odoo versions may not work in newer releases due to API changes.


    **Access Permission Errors**: Review security groups and access rights—users lacking
    required permissions see "Access Denied" errors. Check record rules—domain filters
    may hide records from certain users. Verify user group membership—users must belong
    to appropriate groups inheriting necessary permissions.


    **Integration Failures**: Test API connectivity—network firewalls may block outbound
    connections. Verify credentials—expired API keys or changed passwords break integrations.
    Check rate limits—exceeding API quotas triggers throttling. Review webhook endpoints—incorrect
    URLs or SSL certificate issues prevent callback delivery.


    ## Step-by-Step Troubleshooting Procedures


    Follow systematic troubleshooting: 1) Verify application server service is running,
    2) Check log files for error messages, 3) Test connectivity if network-related,
    4) Review recent configuration changes, 5) Isolate the issue by disabling modules
    one-by-one, 6) Test in safe mode if available.


    ### Database Connection Issues


    1. Verify PostgreSQL service runs: `systemctl status postgresql`

    2. Test direct database connection: `psql -h localhost -U odoo -d production_db`

    3. Check connection limits: `SELECT max_connections FROM pg_settings;`

    4. Monitor active connections: `SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity;`

    5. Review odoo.conf database parameters: host, port, username, password

    6. Check PostgreSQL authentication (pg_hba.conf) allows odoo user access


    ### SSL/HTTPS Problems


    1. Verify certificate validity: `openssl x509 -in /etc/ssl/certs/odoo.crt -noout
    -dates`

    2. Test SSL configuration: `curl -vI https://yourdomain.com`

    3. Check NGINX configuration syntax: `nginx -t`

    4. Review NGINX error logs: `tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log`

    5. Verify proxy_mode enabled in odoo.conf: `proxy_mode = True`

    6. Confirm web.base.url set to HTTPS: Settings → Technical → System Parameters


    ### Email Delivery Failures


    1. Test SMTP connectivity: `telnet smtp.gmail.com 587`

    2. Verify SMTP credentials in Settings → Technical → Outgoing Mail Servers

    3. Check email queue: Settings → Technical → Emails

    4. Review server logs for SMTP errors: `grep -i smtp /var/log/odoo/odoo-server.log`

    5. Verify SPF and DKIM records: Use MXToolbox or similar services

    6. Test email sending: Use Technical menu Send Email feature


    ### Worker Process Crashes


    1. Review memory usage: `ps aux | grep odoo`

    2. Check worker memory limits: `limit_memory_hard` and `limit_memory_soft` in
    odoo.conf

    3. Examine crash dumps if core dumps enabled

    4. Monitor system memory: `free -h` and `vmstat 1`

    5. Review OOM killer logs: `dmesg | grep -i "killed process"`

    6. Adjust worker configuration: Reduce worker count or increase memory limits


    ## Debugging Tools and Techniques


    [{''tool'': ''Odoo Shell'', ''command'': ''python3 odoo-bin shell -d DATABASE_NAME'',
    ''use_case'': ''Interactive debugging and database inspection''}, {''tool'': ''PostgreSQL
    Query Analysis'', ''command'': ''EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT ...'', ''use_case'': ''Performance
    bottleneck identification''}]


    **Odoo Shell**: Access Python REPL with Odoo environment loaded enabling direct
    ORM queries and model inspection. Start with `odoo-bin shell -c /etc/odoo/odoo.conf
    -d your_database`. Test data queries, inspect record values, and execute methods
    interactively.


    **Database Query Profiling**: Enable PostgreSQL query logging by setting `log_min_duration_statement
    = 1000` in postgresql.conf logging queries exceeding 1 second. Review pg_stat_statements
    extension for query performance statistics. Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE understanding
    query execution plans.


    **Python Profilers**: Use cProfile profiling Python code identifying performance
    bottlenecks. Add `--dev=all` flag enabling developer mode with enhanced error
    reporting and JavaScript debugging. Implement logging statements in custom modules
    capturing execution flow.


    **Browser Developer Tools**: Examine network requests identifying failed AJAX
    calls, slow asset loading, or CORS issues. Review console for JavaScript errors
    preventing client-side functionality. Monitor memory usage detecting client-side
    memory leaks in long-running sessions.


    **System Monitoring**: Deploy monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog)
    tracking system metrics over time. Historical data reveals patterns—memory leaks
    gradually consume RAM, disk space exhausts predictably, CPU usage correlates with
    specific operations.


    ## Error Message Interpretation


    Interpret application server error messages by identifying error codes, stack
    traces, and timestamps. Cross-reference error patterns with Odoo documentation
    and community forums. Pay attention to the full error context, not just the final
    message, as root causes often appear earlier in the stack trace.


    Error messages contain diagnostic information but require interpretation—messages
    indicate symptoms, not necessarily root causes.


    **"Database connection failed"**: PostgreSQL service stopped, incorrect credentials,
    network connectivity issues, firewall blocking port 5432, or connection limit
    exhausted.


    **"Access Denied"**: User lacks required permissions, record rules filtering records,
    session expired requiring re-authentication, or API key invalid/revoked.


    **"Module not found"**: Missing module installation, incorrect addons path configuration,
    module naming mismatch, or Python dependencies missing.


    **"Memory Limit Exceeded"**: Worker processing request consuming excessive memory,
    memory limits set too low for workload, memory leak in custom code, or database
    query returning millions of records.


    **"502 Bad Gateway"**: Odoo service not running, worker processes crashed, NGINX
    cannot connect to Odoo backend, or firewall blocking internal communication.


    ## Escalation Procedures


    Escalate to Odoo support if: issue persists after following documented solutions,
    affects production systems causing business disruption, requires deep code-level
    debugging, or involves potential security vulnerabilities. Prepare detailed error
    logs, reproduction steps, and system configuration before escalating.


    When troubleshooting exhausts available expertise, escalate to specialized support
    rather than continuing trial-and-error approaches.


    **Community Resources**: Odoo community forums, Stack Overflow, and GitHub issues
    provide free support from experienced practitioners. Search existing discussions—your
    problem likely occurred previously with documented solutions. When posting questions,
    include Odoo version, complete error messages, relevant configuration, and steps
    already attempted.


    **Odoo Enterprise Support**: Enterprise license subscribers access official Odoo
    support through help desk tickets. Support response time varies by plan—Critical
    (1 hour), High (4 hours), Normal (24 hours). Provide comprehensive problem description,
    logs, and database backup accelerating diagnosis.


    **Professional Consultants**: Engage Odoo partners for complex issues requiring
    specialized expertise. Partners provide remote support or on-site assistance depending
    on problem severity. Typical hourly rates range $100-200/hour with faster problem
    resolution than self-troubleshooting for intricate issues.


    ## Prevention Through Monitoring


    Prevent 500 Internal Server Error recurrence by monitoring application server
    metrics, setting up alerts for resource utilization thresholds, implementing automated
    health checks, maintaining regular backups, and documenting configuration changes.
    Use monitoring tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or New Relic.


    Proactive monitoring detects problems before user impact allowing scheduled maintenance
    rather than emergency responses.


    Configure health check endpoints verifying critical functionality—database connectivity,
    file storage accessibility, external API reachability. External monitoring services
    (UptimeRobot, Pingdom) query health checks every 5 minutes alerting when failures
    occur.


    Set up log aggregation forwarding Odoo, NGINX, PostgreSQL, and system logs to
    centralized logging service (ELK stack, Splunk, Datadog). Configure alerting rules
    identifying error patterns—sudden increase in error rate, repeated failed authentication
    attempts, unusual traffic patterns.


    Track performance metrics establishing baselines for normal operations—average
    response time, 95th percentile latency, active database connections, memory usage,
    disk space consumption. Alert when metrics exceed baseline thresholds indicating
    degrading performance before complete failures.


    Resolving 500 Internal Server Error requires systematic diagnosis, careful testing
    of solutions, and monitoring to prevent recurrence. Document the root cause and
    resolution steps for future reference. Implement preventive measures to catch
    similar issues before they impact users.


    Systematic troubleshooting reduces mean time to resolution from hours to minutes.
    Document solutions in internal knowledge base—next time the issue occurs, resolution
    follows documented procedures rather than rediscovering solutions. Invest time
    in preventive monitoring and documentation—effort multiplies returns across future
    incidents.'
  conclusion: 'The 500 Internal Server Error issue you resolved through systematic
    diagnostic procedure demonstrates troubleshooting methodology that applies beyond
    this specific problem. Understanding where Odoo logs diagnostic information, how
    to interpret error messages that documentation rarely explains clearly, and which
    configuration parameters affect system behavior—this operational knowledge enables
    confident troubleshooting when future issues emerge rather than depending on vendor
    support tickets or external consultants every time production problems occur.


    Document resolution procedures comprehensively in runbooks that future administrators
    reference when similar issues emerge. Include diagnostic steps that identified
    root cause, resolution commands with specific parameters, validation tests confirming
    fix actually resolved problem, and post-incident analysis explaining why issue
    occurred initially. Documentation transforms individual troubleshooting heroics
    into organizational knowledge that persists through staff turnover and enables
    consistent problem resolution regardless of who responds to incidents.


    Implement monitoring that detects recurrence of resolved issues automatically
    rather than waiting for users to report problems. If database connection pool
    exhaustion caused this incident, monitor pool utilization continuously and alert
    before exhaustion recurs. If disk space depletion triggered failures, implement
    capacity alerts providing early warning. Proactive monitoring prevents problem
    recurrence—reactive troubleshooting responds after business disruption already
    occurred.
