  deployment_architecture: Multi-tier clustered architecture with load-balanced application
    servers, replicated database tier, and distributed file storage. Provides high
    availability, fault tolerance, and horizontal scalability for enterprise deployments.
  scaling_strategy: 'Horizontal scaling across all tiers: Add application servers
    dynamically based on load, implement database read replicas for reporting, use
    distributed file storage (S3/NFS) with CDN for static assets. Auto-scaling groups
    respond to traffic spikes automatically.'
  cost_optimization: Leverage auto-scaling to match resources with demand patterns.
    Use spot instances for non-critical application workers (30-70% cost reduction).
    Implement aggressive caching layers (Redis, Varnish, CDN) to reduce database load
    and downstream costs.
  architecture_recommendations: Clustered architecture provides enterprise-grade reliability
    and scalability but requires significant operational expertise. Implement comprehensive
    monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana), automated failover, disaster recovery procedures,
    and regular chaos engineering tests.
  performance_context: At 1000 concurrent users, expect 15000 daily transactions with
    peak load reaching 1500 simultaneous connections. Worker processes should maintain
    <200ms average response time under normal load. Database query optimization becomes
    critical above 800 active users.
  scale_context: Large scale deployment supporting 1000 concurrent users. System handles
    approximately 150000 page views per day with 3000 database transactions per minute
    during peak hours. Requires 160GB RAM and 80 CPU cores for optimal performance.

  introduction: 'Odoo server performance under production workload depends less on
    raw hardware specifications than on proper resource allocation matching actual
    usage patterns. The difference between a struggling sixteen-core server with poor
    PostgreSQL configuration and a smoothly operating eight-core server with optimized
    database parameters illustrates how capacity planning knowledge delivers more
    value than simply purchasing expensive hardware. Understanding where Odoo consumes
    resources—which operations trigger CPU spikes, what workloads drive memory pressure,
    when I/O bottlenecks emerge—enables intelligent infrastructure decisions that
    maximize performance per dollar spent.


    Production Odoo deployments exhibit three distinct resource consumption patterns
    that capacity planning must accommodate. Interactive user operations—form submissions,
    search queries, report generation—create CPU-intensive workloads with moderate
    memory requirements and bursty I/O patterns as PostgreSQL serves cached data with
    occasional disk reads for less-accessed records. Scheduled automation tasks—invoice
    generation batches, inventory valuation calculations, accounting close procedures—generate
    sustained CPU load with high memory consumption and heavy sequential I/O as PostgreSQL
    processes large result sets and writes aggregated data. Background processes—email
    sending, automated actions, webhook deliveries—consume minimal CPU and memory
    but create network I/O and database connection overhead that accumulates across
    concurrent automated workflows.


    This capacity planning guide provides resource allocation formulas calibrated
    against actual production workloads rather than simplified rules of thumb that
    ignore workload diversity. You''ll learn how to calculate PostgreSQL shared_buffers
    allocation based on available RAM and expected database size, determine appropriate
    work_mem values that prevent disk-based query execution without triggering out-of-memory
    errors, size Odoo worker processes to balance parallelism against memory consumption,
    and configure connection pooling to support peak concurrent usage without exhausting
    database connection limits. These operational configurations transform adequate
    hardware into high-performing infrastructure that delivers consistent user experience
    during both normal operations and peak business periods.

  main_content: 'Sizing an Odoo 18 server for 1000 concurrent users requires understanding
    the relationship between user activity patterns, database workload, and hardware
    resources. Large scale deployment supporting 1000 concurrent users. System handles
    approximately 150000 page views per day with 3000 database transactions per minute
    during peak hours. Requires 160GB RAM and 80 CPU cores for optimal performance.


    ## Hardware Specifications and Resource Allocation


    For 1000 users running Odoo 18, the recommended hardware configuration includes
    80 CPU cores, 160GB RAM, and 5000GB disk storage. These specifications account
    for PostgreSQL database operations (40% of resource consumption), Odoo application
    workers (35%), and system overhead (25%). The minimum viable configuration uses
    40 cores and 96GB RAM, but this leaves no headroom for traffic spikes or module-intensive
    operations like MRP calculations or inventory revaluations.


    Clustered architecture provides enterprise-grade reliability and scalability but
    requires significant operational expertise. Implement comprehensive monitoring
    (Prometheus, Grafana), automated failover, disaster recovery procedures, and regular
    chaos engineering tests.


    ## Database Connection Pooling and Worker Configuration


    The database connection pool should maintain 1500 connections to handle concurrent
    user requests without connection exhaustion. Odoo worker processes—set to 80—determine
    simultaneous request handling capacity. Each worker consumes approximately 512MB
    RAM, so total worker memory footprint reaches 40.0GB, leaving 120GB for PostgreSQL
    caching and operating system operations.


    ## Performance Parameters and Scaling Triggers


    At 1000 concurrent users, expect 15000 daily transactions with peak load reaching
    1500 simultaneous connections. Worker processes should maintain <200ms average
    response time under normal load. Database query optimization becomes critical
    above 800 active users.


    Monitor server performance metrics to detect when hardware becomes the bottleneck:
    CPU utilization consistently above 70% during business hours indicates insufficient
    processing power, RAM utilization above 85% causes disk swap and performance degradation,
    and database query times exceeding 500ms suggest either inefficient queries or
    inadequate PostgreSQL memory allocation.


    ## Architecture Patterns for Different Scales


    Multi-tier clustered architecture with load-balanced application servers, replicated
    database tier, and distributed file storage. Provides high availability, fault
    tolerance, and horizontal scalability for enterprise deployments.


    ## Vertical vs. Horizontal Scaling Strategy


    Horizontal scaling across all tiers: Add application servers dynamically based
    on load, implement database read replicas for reporting, use distributed file
    storage (S3/NFS) with CDN for static assets. Auto-scaling groups respond to traffic
    spikes automatically.


    ## Cost-Performance Optimization


    Leverage auto-scaling to match resources with demand patterns. Use spot instances
    for non-critical application workers (30-70% cost reduction). Implement aggressive
    caching layers (Redis, Varnish, CDN) to reduce database load and downstream costs.


    Cloud providers offer various instance types optimized for different workloads.
    For Odoo deployments supporting 1000 users, compute-optimized instances provide
    better performance per dollar than general-purpose instances because Odoo''s worker
    model benefits from higher CPU clock speeds rather than core count alone. Monitor
    actual resource utilization during peak business hours—overprovisioning costs
    30-50% more than right-sized infrastructure, while underprovisioning causes user
    frustration and productivity loss.

    '
  conclusion: 'Your capacity planning work established infrastructure specifications
    matching actual business requirements rather than arbitrary hardware purchases
    or vendor recommendations divorced from operational reality. The calculations
    you completed—CPU core allocation supporting concurrent user workloads, RAM sizing
    accommodating PostgreSQL caching requirements, storage capacity planning for database
    growth trajectories, IOPS provisioning for transaction throughput demands—provide
    foundation supporting business operations for eighteen to thirty-six months before
    architectural revision becomes necessary. This infrastructure investment eliminates
    performance bottlenecks that would otherwise constrain business growth, user productivity,
    and customer-facing operations.


    Validate your capacity planning accuracy through systematic performance monitoring
    during initial production deployment. Install monitoring tools capturing CPU utilization
    patterns, memory consumption under representative workloads, PostgreSQL query
    execution statistics, and disk I/O metrics across typical business cycles. Establish
    performance baselines during first ninety days documenting resource consumption
    for normal operations—month-end close procedures, inventory count processing,
    sales order entry during peak periods, report generation workloads. These baselines
    enable proactive capacity management identifying degradation trends before performance
    problems impact business operations and inform future infrastructure expansion
    decisions through measured growth data rather than speculation.


    Review infrastructure capacity quarterly comparing actual resource utilization
    against planned headroom built into your capacity calculations. If CPU utilization
    consistently exceeds seventy percent during normal operations or peaks above ninety
    percent during month-end processing, schedule compute capacity expansion before
    performance degradation becomes user-visible. If database sizes approach eighty
    percent of provisioned storage, plan storage expansion to prevent emergency disk
    space crises requiring urgent maintenance windows. If PostgreSQL connection counts
    approach configured maximums, investigate connection pooling optimizations or
    plan database tier scaling. The operational discipline of regular capacity review
    prevents infrastructure emergencies through predictive management rather than
    reactive firefighting when systems fail under unexpected load.
