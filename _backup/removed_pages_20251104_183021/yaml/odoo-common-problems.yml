  issue_type: Common Problems
  symptom_description: Users experiencing common problems
  odoo_version: '18'
  component: Application
  diagnostic_approach: Diagnose Common Problems by examining application logs, checking
    service status, and reproducing the issue in a controlled environment. Use systematic
    elimination to isolate the root cause, starting with the most common issues and
    progressing to edge cases.
  common_issues: Common causes of Common Problems include misconfigured application
    settings, insufficient system resources, network connectivity problems, or conflicting
    module dependencies. Check for recent configuration changes or system updates
    that may have triggered the issue.
  troubleshooting_procedures: 'Follow systematic troubleshooting: 1) Verify application
    service is running, 2) Check log files for error messages, 3) Test connectivity
    if network-related, 4) Review recent configuration changes, 5) Isolate the issue
    by disabling modules one-by-one, 6) Test in safe mode if available.'
  debugging_tools:
  - tool: Odoo Shell
    command: python3 odoo-bin shell -d DATABASE_NAME
    use_case: Interactive debugging and database inspection
  - tool: PostgreSQL Query Analysis
    command: EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT ...
    use_case: Performance bottleneck identification
  error_message_guide: Interpret application error messages by identifying error codes,
    stack traces, and timestamps. Cross-reference error patterns with Odoo documentation
    and community forums. Pay attention to the full error context, not just the final
    message, as root causes often appear earlier in the stack trace.
  escalation_guidelines: 'Escalate to Odoo support if: issue persists after following
    documented solutions, affects production systems causing business disruption,
    requires deep code-level debugging, or involves potential security vulnerabilities.
    Prepare detailed error logs, reproduction steps, and system configuration before
    escalating.'
  preventive_monitoring: Prevent Common Problems recurrence by monitoring application
    metrics, setting up alerts for resource utilization thresholds, implementing automated
    health checks, maintaining regular backups, and documenting configuration changes.
    Use monitoring tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or New Relic.
  troubleshooting_conclusion: Resolving Common Problems requires systematic diagnosis,
    careful testing of solutions, and monitoring to prevent recurrence. Document the
    root cause and resolution steps for future reference. Implement preventive measures
    to catch similar issues before they impact users.

  diagnostic_steps:
  - step: 1
    title: Check Error Logs
    commands:
    - sudo tail -n 100 /var/log/odoo/odoo-server.log
    - sudo journalctl -u odoo -n 50
    - grep ERROR /var/log/odoo/odoo-server.log | tail -20
  - step: 2
    title: Verify Application Status
    commands:
    - sudo systemctl status odoo
    - sudo -u postgres psql -c 'SELECT version();'
    - python3 -c 'import odoo; print(odoo.__version__)'
  - step: 3
    title: Test Application Connection
    diagnostic_script: '# Test database connection

      sudo -u postgres psql -d odoo -c "\dt"

      # Check Odoo configuration

      grep -E "" /etc/odoo/odoo.conf
