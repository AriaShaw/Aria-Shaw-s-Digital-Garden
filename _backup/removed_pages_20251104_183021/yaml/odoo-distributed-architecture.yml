  deployment_architecture: Multi-tier clustered architecture with load-balanced application
    servers, replicated database tier, and distributed file storage. Provides high
    availability, fault tolerance, and horizontal scalability for enterprise deployments.
  scaling_strategy: 'Horizontal scaling across all tiers: Add application servers
    dynamically based on load, implement database read replicas for reporting, use
    distributed file storage (S3/NFS) with CDN for static assets. Auto-scaling groups
    respond to traffic spikes automatically.'
  cost_optimization: Leverage auto-scaling to match resources with demand patterns.
    Use spot instances for non-critical application workers (30-70% cost reduction).
    Implement aggressive caching layers (Redis, Varnish, CDN) to reduce database load
    and downstream costs.
  architecture_recommendations: Clustered architecture provides enterprise-grade reliability
    and scalability but requires significant operational expertise. Implement comprehensive
    monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana), automated failover, disaster recovery procedures,
    and regular chaos engineering tests.
  performance_context: At 1000 concurrent users, expect 15000 daily transactions with
    peak load reaching 1500 simultaneous connections. Worker processes should maintain
    <200ms average response time under normal load. Database query optimization becomes
    critical above 800 active users.
  scale_context: Large scale deployment supporting 1000 concurrent users. System handles
    approximately 150000 page views per day with 3000 database transactions per minute
    during peak hours. Requires 160GB RAM and 80 CPU cores for optimal performance.
