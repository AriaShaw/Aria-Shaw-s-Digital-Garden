  deployment_architecture: Application tier and database tier run on separate servers.
    Application handles Odoo workers and reverse proxy, while database tier runs PostgreSQL
    with optimized configuration. Provides better resource isolation and independent
    scaling capabilities.
  scaling_strategy: 'Independent horizontal scaling: Add application servers behind
    load balancer for increased request capacity. Scale database tier vertically with
    RAM and CPU upgrades. Implement read replicas for reporting workloads if needed.'
  cost_optimization: Right-size each tier independently - database tier requires high
    RAM but fewer CPU cores, while application tier benefits from more balanced resources.
    Use reserved instances or savings plans for predictable workloads to reduce cloud
    costs by 30-50%.
  architecture_recommendations: Separated architecture offers excellent balance between
    complexity and scalability for mid-sized deployments. Implement connection pooling
    (PgBouncer), session management (Redis), and automated backups. Monitor each tier
    independently for bottleneck identification.
  performance_context: At 200 concurrent users, expect 3000 daily transactions with
    peak load reaching 300 simultaneous connections. Worker processes should maintain
    <200ms average response time under normal load. Database query optimization becomes
    critical above 160 active users.
  scale_context: Medium scale deployment supporting 200 concurrent users. System handles
    approximately 30000 page views per day with 600 database transactions per minute
    during peak hours. Requires 32GB RAM and 16 CPU cores for optimal performance.
