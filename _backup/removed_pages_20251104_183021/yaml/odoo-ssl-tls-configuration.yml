static_data:
  security_topic: SSL/TLS Configuration
  security_context: Implementing SSL/TLS Configuration protects against network security
    vulnerabilities that could compromise sensitive business data, expose authentication
    credentials, or violate compliance requirements.
  security_hardening_steps: Configure firewall rules to block unauthorized access,
    enable SSL/TLS encryption for all connections, implement reverse proxy with rate
    limiting, disable direct access to port 8069, configure fail2ban for brute force
    protection, enable HTTPS-only redirects, implement certificate pinning, configure
    security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options), enable network segmentation, implement
    VPN for administrative access.
  vulnerability_management_process: Bi-weekly automated vulnerability scanning, critical
    patches applied within 72 hours with change control approval, penetration testing
    semi-annually, security monitoring with 24-hour alert response SLA, monthly security
    configuration audits, documented incident response procedures with quarterly drills,
    security code reviews for custom modules.
  compliance_specific_requirements: Implement industry security best practices following
    OWASP Top 10 guidelines, conduct quarterly security assessments and penetration
    testing, maintain documented security policies and procedures, implement change
    management with approval processes, enable comprehensive audit logging and monitoring,
    conduct regular security awareness training for users, maintain incident response
    and disaster recovery plans with annual testing, implement access control policies
    with periodic review, configure automated security monitoring and alerting, maintain
    vendor security assessment program, document security architecture and network
    diagrams.
  incident_response_plan: 'Designate incident response team with defined roles (Incident
    Commander, Technical Lead, Communications Lead). Detection phase: Monitor security
    alerts from SIEM with 4-hour response SLA, weekly vulnerability scans, quarterly
    threat hunting exercises. Containment phase (within 4 hours): Isolate affected
    systems using network segmentation, disable compromised user accounts, block malicious
    network traffic. Eradication phase (within 72 hours): Remove malicious code, apply
    security patches, conduct forensic analysis to identify attack vectors. Recovery
    phase: Restore from backups with integrity verification, monitor recovered systems
    for 30 days, validate security controls. Post-incident: Document incident timeline
    and lessons learned, update security runbooks, conduct incident response drill
    semi-annually.'
  security_monitoring_details: 'Deploy centralized logging infrastructure using ELK
    Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Graylog. Monitor critical security
    events: authentication failures, access control violations, system errors, database
    connection anomalies, web application errors. Configure alert rules: 10 failed
    logins within 15 minutes triggers alert, database connection spikes (>200% normal)
    trigger investigation, certificate expiration warnings 30 days in advance. Enable
    Intrusion Detection System (Suricata or Snort) with updated rule sets. Integrate
    with vulnerability scanning tools (OpenVAS) for continuous monitoring. Retain
    logs for 90 days online and 2 years archived. Create security dashboards tracking
    key metrics: login success/failure rates, vulnerability counts by severity, patch
    compliance percentage. Configure email and Slack notifications for High/Critical
    alerts with 4-hour response SLA.'
  security_conclusion: Implementing SSL/TLS Configuration following industry best
    practices significantly enhances your Odoo security posture and reduces high-priority
    risk exposure. This implementation provides essential protection against common
    attack vectors while establishing foundational security controls for future maturity.
    Schedule regular security assessments (quarterly for high-risk environments, annually
    for standard deployments) to identify new vulnerabilities and validate control
    effectiveness. Maintain security awareness through ongoing staff training, security
    champions program, and regular communication of security policies. As your Odoo
    deployment grows and threat landscape evolves, revisit and enhance these security
    controls, implement additional defense-in-depth layers, and consider pursuing
    formal security certifications (ISO 27001, SOC 2) to demonstrate security commitment
    to stakeholders. Security is a journey of continuous improvement, requiring sustained
    investment, executive support, and cultural commitment to protecting your organization's
    critical business systems and data assets.
