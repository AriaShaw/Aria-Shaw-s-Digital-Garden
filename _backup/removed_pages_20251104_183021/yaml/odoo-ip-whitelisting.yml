  security_topic: Security Hardening
  security_context: Implementing Security Hardening protects against general security
    vulnerabilities that could compromise sensitive business data, expose authentication
    credentials, or violate compliance requirements.
  security_hardening_steps: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing,
    implement security monitoring with alerts, enable centralized logging to SIEM,
    configure automated security updates, implement intrusion detection system (IDS),
    conduct regular vulnerability scans, maintain security incident response plan,
    implement security awareness training, configure security baselines and hardening
    checklists, enable automated compliance reporting.
  vulnerability_management_process: Monthly vulnerability assessments, patch management
    following vendor release schedule with 30-day testing window, annual penetration
    testing, security monitoring with business hours alert response, quarterly access
    control audits, documented security policies reviewed annually, security awareness
    training for development team.
  compliance_specific_requirements: Implement industry security best practices following
    OWASP Top 10 guidelines, conduct quarterly security assessments and penetration
    testing, maintain documented security policies and procedures, implement change
    management with approval processes, enable comprehensive audit logging and monitoring,
    conduct regular security awareness training for users, maintain incident response
    and disaster recovery plans with annual testing, implement access control policies
    with periodic review, configure automated security monitoring and alerting, maintain
    vendor security assessment program, document security architecture and network
    diagrams.
  incident_response_plan: 'Assign security point of contact with escalation procedures
    to management and IT team. Detection phase: Daily review of security logs, automated
    alerts for critical events, monthly security audits. Containment phase (within
    24 hours): Disconnect affected systems from network, preserve system logs for
    analysis, notify stakeholders per communication plan. Eradication phase (within
    1 week): Identify and remove root cause, apply relevant patches and updates, scan
    for similar vulnerabilities across infrastructure. Recovery phase: Restore from
    backups after validation, implement additional monitoring for affected areas,
    verify business operations resume normally. Post-incident: Create incident report
    with recommendations, update security documentation, review and improve incident
    response procedures annually.'
  security_monitoring_details: 'Configure basic security monitoring using syslog with
    centralized collection. Monitor essential events: system login/logout, sudo command
    execution, service start/stop, firewall denials, application errors. Set up Fail2ban
    for automated brute-force protection (3 failed attempts in 10 minutes = 1-hour
    ban). Enable daily log review for unusual activity patterns. Use free tools: OSSEC
    for file integrity monitoring, Nagios for uptime and performance monitoring. Configure
    email alerts for critical events: service failures, disk space >90%, SSL certificate
    expiration <14 days. Retain logs for 30 days with weekly backup to secure storage.
    Create monthly security summary reports reviewing alert trends and recommending
    improvements. Implement basic security checklist with monthly manual review of
    user permissions, open ports, and installed packages.'
  security_conclusion: Implementing Security Hardening following industry best practices
    significantly enhances your Odoo security posture and reduces medium-priority
    risk exposure. This implementation provides essential protection against common
    attack vectors while establishing foundational security controls for future maturity.
    Schedule regular security assessments (quarterly for high-risk environments, annually
    for standard deployments) to identify new vulnerabilities and validate control
    effectiveness. Maintain security awareness through ongoing staff training, security
    champions program, and regular communication of security policies. As your Odoo
    deployment grows and threat landscape evolves, revisit and enhance these security
    controls, implement additional defense-in-depth layers, and consider pursuing
    formal security certifications (ISO 27001, SOC 2) to demonstrate security commitment
    to stakeholders. Security is a journey of continuous improvement, requiring sustained
    investment, executive support, and cultural commitment to protecting your organization's
    critical business systems and data assets.
