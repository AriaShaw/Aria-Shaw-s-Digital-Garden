static_data:
  security_topic: Backup Security
  security_context: Implementing Backup Security protects against data protection
    vulnerabilities that could compromise sensitive business data, expose authentication
    credentials, or violate compliance requirements.
  security_hardening_steps: Enable database encryption at rest using LUKS/dm-crypt,
    encrypt backups with GPG, implement automated backup rotation, configure secure
    backup storage with versioning, enable database audit logging, implement data
    masking for sensitive fields, configure PostgreSQL SSL connections, enable point-in-time
    recovery, implement backup integrity verification, configure offsite backup replication.
  vulnerability_management_process: Weekly vulnerability scans using automated tools
    (OpenVAS, Nessus), immediate patching of critical vulnerabilities within 24 hours,
    penetration testing quarterly by certified security professionals, continuous
    monitoring for zero-day exploits, automated security baseline validation daily,
    incident response team on-call 24/7, mandatory security reviews before any production
    deployment.
  compliance_specific_requirements: Implement industry security best practices following
    OWASP Top 10 guidelines, conduct quarterly security assessments and penetration
    testing, maintain documented security policies and procedures, implement change
    management with approval processes, enable comprehensive audit logging and monitoring,
    conduct regular security awareness training for users, maintain incident response
    and disaster recovery plans with annual testing, implement access control policies
    with periodic review, configure automated security monitoring and alerting, maintain
    vendor security assessment program, document security architecture and network
    diagrams.
  incident_response_plan: 'Establish 24/7 Security Operations Center (SOC) with on-call
    incident response team. Detection phase: Real-time SIEM monitoring with automated
    threat detection, continuous vulnerability scanning, user behavior analytics (UBA)
    for anomaly detection. Containment phase (immediate): Isolate affected systems
    within 15 minutes, disable compromised accounts, block malicious IPs at perimeter,
    preserve forensic evidence. Eradication phase (within 24 hours): Remove malware
    using EDR tools, patch exploited vulnerabilities, reset all potentially compromised
    credentials. Recovery phase: Restore from verified clean backups, implement enhanced
    monitoring on recovered systems, conduct security validation testing. Post-incident:
    Mandatory root cause analysis, update threat intelligence feeds, implement preventive
    controls, conduct tabletop exercises quarterly.'
  security_monitoring_details: 'Implement enterprise SIEM solution (Splunk Enterprise,
    IBM QRadar, or LogRhythm) with real-time correlation rules. Monitor 50+ security
    event types including: failed authentication attempts, privilege escalation, unusual
    data transfers, configuration changes, database queries, API calls, file integrity
    changes. Configure alert thresholds: 5 failed logins within 5 minutes triggers
    account lockout, any privilege escalation triggers immediate SOC notification,
    after-hours admin activity requires approval. Enable User and Entity Behavior
    Analytics (UEBA) with machine learning baselines. Integrate threat intelligence
    feeds (MISP, AlienVault OTX) for IOC matching. Maintain 1-year hot storage and
    7-year cold storage for compliance. Configure automated response actions: block
    suspicious IPs, disable compromised accounts, isolate infected systems. Conduct
    daily log analysis reviews and weekly security metrics reporting to management.'
  security_conclusion: Implementing Backup Security following industry best practices
    significantly enhances your Odoo security posture and reduces critical-priority
    risk exposure. This implementation provides essential protection against common
    attack vectors while establishing foundational security controls for future maturity.
    Schedule regular security assessments (quarterly for high-risk environments, annually
    for standard deployments) to identify new vulnerabilities and validate control
    effectiveness. Maintain security awareness through ongoing staff training, security
    champions program, and regular communication of security policies. As your Odoo
    deployment grows and threat landscape evolves, revisit and enhance these security
    controls, implement additional defense-in-depth layers, and consider pursuing
    formal security certifications (ISO 27001, SOC 2) to demonstrate security commitment
    to stakeholders. Security is a journey of continuous improvement, requiring sustained
    investment, executive support, and cultural commitment to protecting your organization's
    critical business systems and data assets.
